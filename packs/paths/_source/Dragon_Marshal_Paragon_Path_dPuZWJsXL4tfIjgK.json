			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlord </p><p>Entire schools of study have been devoted to the topic of making war upon dragons and other fearsome beasts of great size, and you have studied them all. Whether leading an adventuring party or an entire army, you are most at home with the swords and spells of allies behind you, and one really big target before you. </p><p><b>DRAGON MARSHAL PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Vengeance for All (11th level)</b></p><p>When you take damage from a close or area attack, each ally you can see who was also a target of that attack gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the creature that attacked you until the end of your next turn. If the attacker is a dragon, it is a +2 bonus. </p><p><b>Unflagging Spirit (16th level)</b></p><p>When an ally you can see spends an action point to make an attack and misses, the ally gains temporary hit points equal to your level and can make a saving throw. If the ally's attack missed a dragon, the ally regains hit points equal to your level instead of gaining temporary hit points. </p><p><b>DRAGON MARSHAL POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dQF3iMcrAIC8NuJW]{Dragon Marshal 11-Beast-Surrounding Maneuver}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.oWiCGlPQaR06mVD9]{Dragon Marshal 12-Hit Him Where it Hurts!}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.sLVx5fEGgJz8Y4yt]{Dragon Marshal 20-Breath-Taking Slam}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 51. </p>",

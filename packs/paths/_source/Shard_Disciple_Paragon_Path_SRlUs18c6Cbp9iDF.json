			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shardmind </p><p>A shardmind's physical form is an amalgamation of crystalline shards that shardminds believe are fragments of the Living Gate, bound together by force of will into a humanoid form. Every shardmind has a limited ability to alter that form. </p><p>You, however, are a shard disciple; you have learned how to relax the bonds of your form to the point where your body becomes a swirling storm of crystalline fragments. You can disperse your body to protect yourself from attacks, and your shard swarm racial power lets you form yourself into a lethal cloud of crystals. As you advance in level, you learn to disperse your consciousness into your component fragments, allowing you to quickly recover from mortal injury or even maintain your consciousness in the form of a swirling storm of shards and psionic energy. </p><p><b>SHARD DISCIPLE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Perfect Shard Swarm (11th level)</b></p><p>Your shard swarm racial power becomes a close burst 2, instead of a close burst 1. In addition, you can use shard swarm to teleport your speed, instead of half your speed. </p><p><b>Swarm Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you take half damage from melee attacks and ranged attacks until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Constant Swarm (16th level)</b></p><p>You can use your shard swarm racial power one additional time during each encounter. </p><p><b>SHARD DISCIPLE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Koei0FIDWXA938Va]{Shard Disciple 11-Irruption of the Living Gate}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Pbie7xvAaUr63NtH]{Shard Disciple 12-Recrystallize}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.TbjDW7RcME5miZ4B]{Shard Disciple 20-Shard Storm}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 19. </p>",

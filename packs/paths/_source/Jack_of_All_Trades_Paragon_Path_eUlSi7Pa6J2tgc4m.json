			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Rogue </p><p>You are a jack-of-all-trades; learning new skills comes naturally to you, and you enjoy pitting your abilities against any challenge. Your thirst for knowledge will drive you to learn new skills until the day you die. </p><p>Since your youth, you have had an intense yearning to learn more than what books and teachers could provide. You understood from a young age that knowledge and skill can take you places that money and influence can't. You hoard knowledge the way a dragon covets its treasure, though you are happy to share it with anyone you consider worthy, or when doing so suits your fancy. </p><p>Folks might consider you a pack rat or a dabbler, but you know that the items you collect and the skills you acquire will help you in the future. And when you're there to save the day, anyone who derided your habits will realize the mistake and thank you. </p><p>Eladrin are a natural choice for this path because of their high Dexterity and Intelligence, as well as the fact that they gain an additional skill of their choice. Humans also excel as jacks-of-all-trades because of their vast variety of experiences and versatility of skill and knowledge. </p><p><b>JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dabbler (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to all skill checks. </p><p><b>Expert Assault (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +5 bonus to skill checks until the end of your turn. </p><p><b>Advanced Dabbler (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain training in three skills. </p><p><b>JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.7hoXGSzx1sQMWbNT]{Jack-of-All-Trades 11-Scoundrel's Philosophy}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.me8FkOG39cIMvzrT]{Jack-of-All-Trades 12-Always a Natural}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.396ShawJ4QLfHdug]{Jack-of-All-Trades 20-Every Trick in the Book}</p><p>Published in Martial Power 2, page(s) 75. </p>",

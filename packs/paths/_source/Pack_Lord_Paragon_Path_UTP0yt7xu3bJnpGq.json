			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid </p><p>With each evocation you cast, you hear the distant growls and cries of your pack. They wait for your magic to call them forth into battle, and they are eager to fight. You strengthen them with your magic, and you draw power from them. You are at your mightiest when you stand at the head of your summoned pack. </p><p>When you summon the beasts of your pack, your evocations echo through them. Their wounds knit shut, and they leap to attack with a ferocity augmented by your primal magic. In turn, you draw on their feral strength to endure your enemy's attacks and to strengthen your own. </p><p><b>PACK LORD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Natural Pack Member (11th level)</b></p><p>While you have at least one summoned creature present, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and all defenses. </p><p><b>Pack Intensity (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can give a single minor action command to one of your summoned creatures as a free action. If you don't give any other commands to that creature during this turn, the creature uses its instinctive effect at the end of your turn. </p><p><b>Natural Vitality (16th level)</b></p><p>Creatures you summon with your druid powers gain regeneration equal to your Wisdom modifier while they are bloodied. </p><p><b>Great Summoning (20th level)</b></p><p>You gain a 19th-level druid summoning power. </p><p><b>PACK LORD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.qfgsmz1i2twTESOF]{Pack Lord 11-Alpha's Command}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eXq4RaSdGV7olyzB]{Pack Lord 12-Full Pack}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 55. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin </p><p>As a knight of Celestia, you are an icon of virtue, championing the causes of Celestia and doing battle with those that seek its ruin. Although you retain devotion to your own deity, you also enjoy the favor of the gods that dwell in Celestia. You advance the agendas of the deities of Celestia in addition to that of your patron deity. </p><p>When you use your knight of Celestia powers, a flickering flame appears above your head, displaying the blessing the gods have bestowed upon you. </p><p><b>KNIGHT OF CELESTIA PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Aura of Menace (11th level)</b></p><p>When a creature that you have marked takes radiant damage from your divine challenge, the creature sheds bright light on 20 squares in all directions and grants combat advantage to any attacker until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Blessing of the Gods (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Dedicated Foe (16th level)</b></p><p>When you score a critical hit against an enemy that you have marked with divine challenge, the attack ignores the creature's resistances, and the target takes radiant damage from divine challenge as if it had made an attack that didn't include you as a target. This damage triggers your aura of menace. </p><p><b>KNIGHT OF CELESTIA POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.G5DvAilrQ2tz96JZ]{Knight of Celestia 11-Celestia's Challenge}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.nMAtX9EYdCkFamfu]{Knight of Celestia 12-Brilliant Guardians}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.G9W3n6SLq5HFpyxV]{Knight of Celestia 20-Purifying Radiance}</p><p>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 143. </p>",

The bonus equals one-half your level. </p><p><b>Warpriest's Strategy (11th level)</b></p><p>Once per encounter, if you or an adjacent ally rolls a 1 when making a melee attack or a close attack, you can call for a reroll. </p><p><b>Warpriest's Training (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing heavy armor. </p><p><b>Warpriest's Challenge (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with an at-will melee attack, you can choose to mark that enemy for the rest of the encounter.

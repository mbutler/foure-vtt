			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Shadow feat, trained in Stealth </p><p>You're among the deadliest assassins that House Thuranni has to offer. You are the scourge of House Phiarlan and anyone else who has enemies with the coin to afford your services. You kill silently, and you're adept at infiltrating enemy strongholds. You eliminate targets with ruthless efficiency and return to your house's compounds unscathed. Thuranni shadow killers are careful to ensure that their deeds go unnoticed by most of Khorvaire's population. </p><p><b>THURANNI SHADOW KILLER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Shadow-Fade Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you become invisible until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Thuranni Silence (11th level)</b></p><p>Any ally within 3 squares of you who is not trained in Stealth gains a +3 bonus to Stealth checks. </p><p><b>Shadow Wound (16th level)</b></p><p>Once per round when you hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you, your attack also deals ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends). You decide whether to apply the ongoing damage after making the damage roll. The damage increases to ongoing 10 necrotic at 21st level. </p><p><b>THURANNI SHADOW KILLER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.cp6xKYkqIta4yZij]{Thuranni Shadow Killer 11-Descending Shadows}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.K31DS0lbAUB4dsoC]{Thuranni Shadow Killer 12-Shadowstep}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3eSNq02vQfRcigUA]{Thuranni Shadow Killer 20-Spectral Garrote}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.TWxN15REnkq03G7l]{Thuranni Shadow Killer 20-Spectral Garrote Attack}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 78. </p>",

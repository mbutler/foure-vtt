			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock, vestige pact </p><p>Centuries ago, a powerful covenant of warlocks known as the Umbral Cabal summoned a demon lord to do its bidding. The demon, known as Kulnoghrim the Terrible, committed such horrific deeds of carnage and madness that it became too much for the warlocks to bear. The group bound the fiend by using a forbidden ritual, destroying themselves in the process and leaving Kulnoghrim to languish into obscurity. </p><p>By studying their methods, you gain the ability to ward yourself from attack and bind your foes as this cabal did the great demon lord. With each secret you uncover, you grow closer to accomplishing what they could not: gaining the ability to bind Kulnoghrim as a vestige and unleashing his demonic fury to burn your enemies and drive them mad. </p><p><b>UMBRAL CABALIST PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Cabalist's Warding (11th level)</b></p><p>When you become bloodied, you gain a bonus to your choice of Fortitude, Reflex, or Will equal to your Constitution modifier until you are no longer bloodied. </p><p><b>Restricting Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point, you restrain one enemy affected by your Warlock's Curse until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Demonic Resilience (16th level)</b></p><p>The first time you take typed damage in each encounter, you gain resist 10 to that damage type until the end of the encounter. </p><p><b>UMBRAL CABALIST POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.UlQukIXRwEGxNf1m]{Umbral Cabalist 11-Command of the Abyss}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.cqMHuj1fyNr4SEzQ]{Umbral Cabalist 12-Clarifying Rebuke}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RLioDSIcWl7N0jQK]{Umbral Cabalist 20-Vestige of Kulnoghrim}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 383, page(s) 42. </p>",

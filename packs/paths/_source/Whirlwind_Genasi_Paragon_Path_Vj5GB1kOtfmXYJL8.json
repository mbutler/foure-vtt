			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, windsoul elemental manifestation </p><p>The wind is immortal. Air moves and flows around us all, it is a source of life, and yet it is capable of wreaking terrible destruction. Hurricanes and windstorms can bring a castle down around a king's ears, or hurl even the greatest hero off a cliff to rocky death below. Your race is connected to the currents of air as you are to all the elements, but for you air is not just a part of your soul; it is a source of incredible power. You are a whirlwind genasi, and your supremacy over wind is the stuff of legend. </p><p>Flight, the ability to send your foes sprawling with gale-force wind, or the power to sweep the field of battle with a boulder-crushing, tree-splintering tornado are all as commonplace to you as a casual wave of your hand. You control the flow of a fight, using your power over air to move your foes like pawns around a chessboard. </p><p><b>WHIRLWIND GENASI PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Whirlwind Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain the use of the windwalker encounter power one additional time in this encounter. </p><p><b>Whirlwind Breeze (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use the windwalker encounter power, you gain a fly speed of 8 until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Whirlwind Counterforce (16th level)</b></p><p>When you are pulled, pushed, or slid, you can either decrease the distance by 1 square or increase it by 1 square. If you choose to increase it, you decide the last square you move into. If a creature pulls you into a square adjacent to it, you can increase the pull by 1 as long as you end in another square adjacent to it. </p><p><b>WHIRLWIND GENASI POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RTJyQeduA0cv8SsX]{Whirlwind Genasi 11-Tumbling Gale}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dHvzp2y9YjTF8Om1]{Whirlwind Genasi 12-Windsoul Zephyr}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.C59zBRIu2Da0AVib]{Whirlwind Genasi 20-Windsoul Whirlwind}</p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 70. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Bard, any primal class </p><p>The myths told and retold by the people of the world have power, changing the past even as they shape the future. Warriors gather around fires to swap tales about the Great Bear and the World Serpent, while shamans whisper portents revealed to them by the Fate Weaver to any who will listen. Though such stories live large in those who revere the oral tradition of storytelling, they are not guarded, not secret, and any who would listen and learn from them can touch their great power. </p><p>As a mythic skald, you may have spent your life among a primal tribe, living beyond the civilized lands and there kept your people's traditions alive. You might have served as an advisor to your chieftain or even fought alongside your fellow warriors, filling them with courage through your tales. Regardless, you use arcane magic to bring the ancient tales to life, filling your companions with glorious visions and unrivaled courage, revealing the deeper meanings in the legends you have picked up during your travels. </p><p><b>MYTHIC SKALD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Hero's Blood (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you bloodies an enemy with an attack, you can grant a different ally within 5 squares a +2 power bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls on its next attack in this encounter. </p><p><b>Mythic Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an extra attack and hit with that attack, each ally within 5 squares that can see you gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>Primal Virtue (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use majestic word on yourself or an ally, the target also gains a +2 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>MYTHIC SKALD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.2cO8XjymCV6giHTE]{Mythic Skald 11-Skald's Tale}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.EJxopDQKmZnrLHAg]{Mythic Skald 12-Mythic Destiny}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.FhIjYqpHCwEr9oma]{Mythic Skald 20-Manifest the Mighty Hero}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 57. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter </p><p>The Doomguard is a nihilistic society of mercenaries, marauders, and freebooters that troubles the domains of good and evil alike. As a member of the Doomguard, you believe the universe is sliding toward destruction and that everything eventually comes to an end. The best of the Doomguard are free-willed revolutionaries who fight to overthrow tyranny and stifling order; the worst are murderous villains who revel in destruction. </p><p>As a Doomguard Marauder, you possess the traits of an anarchist. Laws run counter to nature and deprive mortals of the freedom to choose their fate. For good or bad, the Doomguard is ever the enemies of tyranny and government. The society's members especially hate devils, and they continuously wage war against them. </p><p><b>DOOMGUARD MARAUDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Destructive Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you deal 1d12 extra damage on attacks made before the end of your turn. The damage increases to 2d12 at 21st level. </p><p><b>Ruin's Reward (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. </p><p><b>Inevitable Doom (16th level)</b></p><p>When you miss with a melee weapon attack, you gain a +2 bonus to your next melee attack roll against that creature. </p><p><b>DOOMGUARD MARAUDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.EN0eODbWd72orBMl]{Doomguard Marauder 11-Entropic Blow}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.sRl5xfPZh6YK1tX2]{Doomguard Marauder 12-Strike of Unmaking}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ENQFWVYjbhGwfHg9]{Doomguard Marauder 20-Arm of Dissolution}</p><p>Published in Manual of the Planes, page(s) 141. </p>",

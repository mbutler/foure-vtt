			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer, Wild Magic class feature </p><p>As a luckbender, your manipulation of chance is a way of life. You're accustomed to turning failure into success and cheating your way through dangerous situations. As your connection to the Elemental Chaos grows stronger, you can influence chaos in the actions of others, as well as place wagers on your own fate by using attacks and abilities that open up the full potential of chance to intervene on your behalf. With this path, you might make deliberate wagers on the whims of chaos, or swagger with the assured confidence of a master gambler. Either way, luck is on your side. </p><p><b>LUCKBENDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Chaos Soul (11th level)</b></p><p>When you roll initiative, you can reroll your Wild Soul resistance and keep the new result. </p><p><b>Luckbender's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a sorcerer attack, choose 1-10 or 11-20. If the result on the die for the first attack roll you make as a part of that attack is within the range selected, you regain the use of your lowest-level sorcerer encounter attack power. </p><p><b>Lucky Number (16th level)</b></p><p>You score a critical hit with sorcerer and luckbender attack powers on a result of 19-20. </p><p><b>LUCKBENDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.BVCiR9KqGFOIdPA2]{Luckbender 11-Fortunate Turn of Events}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.2JCjra49PutwqiYo]{Luckbender 12-Even the Odds}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eAuN1BEOzj3xvp2K]{Luckbender 20-Just Not Their Day}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 48. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard </p><p>Many wizards study the ways of dragons. What better source of ancient lore and potent magic, after all, than creatures capable of living a thousand years or more? You, too, have chosen to study these great beasts, but because you believe them a menace or a great evil. For whatever reason, you hone your spells to best counter and destroy the legendary creatures. </p><p><b>DRACONIC ANTITHESIS PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Countering Thesis (11th level)</b></p><p>When you take damage of a certain type, you gain resist 5 against that damage type until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Sky-Slayer (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against flying creatures. </p><p><b>DRACONIC ANTITHESIS POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Uj62tquiP0lVE95w]{Draconic Antithesis 11-Energy Dispersal}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.V7ACgXIklZJevLDU]{Draconic Antithesis 12-Earth-Binder}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.PCdi5FoTJX1VDc8Y]{Draconic Antithesis 20-Energy Disruption}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 52. </p>",

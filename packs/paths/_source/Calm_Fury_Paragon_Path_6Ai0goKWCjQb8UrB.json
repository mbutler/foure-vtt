			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian, rage strike power </p><p>In the past, you raged like any other barbarian. Then you learned the secret power that comes from being able to harness your fury. You now attain the furious clarity on the far side of rage. You walk a perfectly controlled sword's edge of lethal potential. </p><p>It might have been a specific catastrophe-a moment when you had spent yourself in savagery and could not respond to a new and greater threat-that showed you the way to a higher plane of rage. Or you might have felt a call to a deeper understanding of rage, one that eludes other barbarians. </p><p>You have the spirit and the understanding of an elder. You are able to look beyond the next few bloody moments toward what might be best for the future. The primal spirits you call on are wise and strong. They share with you a broad perspective, the knowledge that controlled fury can be stronger than rage without restraint. </p><p><b>CALM FURY PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Certain Savagery (11th level)</b></p><p>You don't need to be raging to use rage strike. If you miss every target, you don't expend rage strike. In addition, when you miss with rage strike, you don't deal half damage. </p><p><b>Strength in Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you regain hit points equal to one-half your level + your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Relentless Pace (16th level)</b></p><p>You can use rage strike three times per day, and it deals 1[W] extra damage. </p><p><b>CALM FURY POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.6o9LY4I1T8sfAygH]{Calm Fury 11-Furious Calm}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ybrR1TlNz8EQegiX]{Calm Fury 12-Deliberate Rampage}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ZvHCftN7OsynmxFq]{Calm Fury 20-Lethal Ancestor Rage}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 27. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Minotaur </p><p>You are the master of ways, routes, and paths. You have walked the lightless stone corridors of the Underdark, navigated the winding roads of humans and found your path through the enchanted forests of the Feywild. The labyrinth holds no terror for you. Its endless variations and routes contain your fortress, your philosophy, and your way. </p><p>For the minotaur who can discern its patterns, life is a great labyrinth, each new choice a path leading to a different destiny. Few possess the discipline to navigate the vast maze of the mind and soul without losing themselves to temptation and their own savage natures. Guided by the tenets of contemplation, vigilance, and reflection, though your choices have made you master of your own desire. </p><p>To the champion of the labyrinth, the battlefield is a maze as familiar as any other, and you move to take advantage of it. You control your own fate, and the direction you choose to travel here. As it is in life, so shall it be in battle. </p><p><b>CHAMPION OF THE LABYRINTH PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Maze Adept Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and speed and a +5 bonus to Athletics checks until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Uncanny Mobility (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +4 bonus to saving throws against effects that immobilize or slow.

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid </p><p>You have mastered the form of the coiled serpent, a sleek, stealthy beast form that carries the promise of pain and poison for your enemies. Some druids keep their distance from serpentine beasts, but you recognize such creatures as being just as integral to the natural world as anything that has fur or feathers. You call on cold-eyed serpent spirits, and your connection to the cobra, the adder, and the python gives you a subtle magic. </p><p>As a coiled serpent, you gain abilities that let you grab creatures, deal poison damage, and move swiftly. </p><p><b>COILED SERPENT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Serpent Form (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are in beast form, you gain resist 15 poison and a +5 bonus to Stealth checks.

You might visit retribution on those who serve evil and destruction, or you might be a ruthless killer, hunting down those who offend you. Regardless, you are a creature of nightmare-a thing of the shadows-and those who earn your ire can know only a terrifying end. </p><p><b>NIGHTMARE WEAVER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Insidious Curse (11th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points, you can place a Warlock's Curse on the enemy nearest to you as an immediate reaction. If the nearest enemy is already affected by your Warlock's Curse, you can slide it 2 squares, and it takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Nightmarish Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point to make an attack, you can slide creatures affected by your Warlock's Curse 1 square. Those you slide take a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Shaking Displays (16th level)</b></p><p>All your warlock encounter attack spells, along with painful delusion below, gain the rattling keyword. </p><p><b>NIGHTMARE WEAVER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.1PbtmCxwIRugs7Zd]{Nightmare Weaver 11-Painful Delusion}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.NuDCXd5o72wxpY0K]{Nightmare Weaver 12-Dread Disappearance}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RaK6GDfJrA1luXgm]{Nightmare Weaver 20-Nightmare Stalker}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 373, page(s) 21. </p>",

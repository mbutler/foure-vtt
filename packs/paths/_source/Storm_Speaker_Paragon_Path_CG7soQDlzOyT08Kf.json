			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid </p><p>The might of primal storms-furious things of lightning, thunder, and rain-courses through your magic. Few druids walk the path of the storm speaker, for it is fraught with indomitable forces that can be channeled only temporarily, rather than truly controlled. The storm speaker dabbles with primal powers that dance and surge across the sky, free of all fetters. </p><p>Storm speakers seek out broad plains, the better to see and study storms that sweep across the sky. Their lodges are marked by tall spikes of iron marked with yellow and blue runes. During a storm, a speaker meditates within one of these lodges, allowing his or her mind to wander among the winds and rain. If the storms are open to sharing their secrets, bolts of lightning strike the iron spikes, sending waves of primal energy over the speaker, fortifying his or her power. </p><p><b>STORM SPEAKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Storm Speaker Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also fly 8 squares as a free action. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. </p><p><b>Storm Touched (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain resist 5 lightning and resist 5 thunder. Whenever you take lightning or thunder damage, you gain 5 temporary hit points, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with primal powers until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Dancing Tempest (16th level)</b></p><p>Once per round when you hit an enemy with a lightning or a thunder power, you can shift 1 square as a free action. </p><p><b>STORM SPEAKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3yx6XGmS4hKlbzAp]{Storm Speaker 11-Storm Beast}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eSpHoF9c6jqE1IQN]{Storm Speaker 12-Shield of Gales}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eV2nqgZ4NFd5uihb]{Storm Speaker 20-Storm Child}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 58. </p>",

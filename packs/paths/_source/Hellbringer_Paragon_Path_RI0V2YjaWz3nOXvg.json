			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock, infernal pact </p><p>Your choice to swear a pact to an infernal entity in exchange for power was not an easy choice, but it was a choice you made with open eyes. You understand the moral dangers implicit in your pact, but you believe that your soul can withstand the physical and mental forces of Hell. Though devils constantly attempt to lure you into their sinister plots, you remain steadfast against their persuasion. </p><p>When an opportunity came to claim even more strength from your devilish patrons, you leaped at it. You accepted their empowering flames, wearing your might like a crown. Sometimes your allies worry about the ultimate fate of your soul, but you laugh off their concern. You assure them that you are in no danger, and that they need not pity you. However, you have heard the call of darkness, and sometimes you question what destination awaits you when you die. </p><p><b>HELLBRINGER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Flames of Empowerment (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a ranged attack, and that attack hits, it deals 2d6 extra fire damage to the attack's target and each enemy that is adjacent to the target. </p><p><b>No Pity, No Mercy (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit against an enemy, that creature grants combat advantage to you and gains vulnerable 5 fire until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Prince of Hell (16th level)</b></p><p>Your arcane attack powers ignore resistance to fire. </p><p><b>HELLBRINGER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.enfVRm5cyTsKG8gq]{Hellbringer 11-Pillar of Power}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.HLWiZE8hS1t03raB]{Hellbringer 12-Gates of Hell}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ajzJHbTCwOn5ovek]{Hellbringer 20-Unleash the Inferno}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 91. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind </p><p>Your mind rejects all notions of what is possible and impossible on the battlefield. Psionic energy flows through you, imbuing you with an irrepressible need to move. You flow around your enemies, blurring past them before they can land a blow. As you move, your attacks slip through your enemies' defenses with deadly effect. You goad a foe into following you, then wrack its mind and body as it gives futile chase. </p><p>You are quicksilver in living form, moving with such speed and grace that your enemies have no hope of pinning you down. Whether you fight alone or in the company of others who also race through the heat of battle, your enemies name you the quicksilver demon, never knowing where you will strike next. </p><p><b>QUICKSILVER DEMON PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Quicksilver Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier before or after the extra action. </p><p><b>Quicksilver Dance (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +4 bonus to all defenses against opportunity attacks. In addition, whenever an enemy misses you with an opportunity attack, you gain combat advantage against that enemy until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Unfettered Movement (16th level)</b></p><p>You can shift 3 squares as a move action. When you do, you are no longer slowed. </p><p><b>QUICKSILVER DEMON POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dsWlZaBLrKhuToq3]{Quicksilver Demon 11-Rebounding Dance}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.pVM4ZHKduxUvs5Oa]{Quicksilver Demon 12-Absorb Momentum}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.bj5XaFcPV84kdxHh]{Quicksilver Demon 20-Aspect of Quicksilver Strides}</p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 50. </p>",

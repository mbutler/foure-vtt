			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Bard </p><p>Fey tricksters, gnomes, and storytellers of every race know many legends unfamiliar to other creatures-tales from secluded forests, burrows deep underground, the lairs of powerful beasts, and the locked vaults of powerful monarchs. And what they don't know, they make up. </p><p>As a cunning prevaricator, you traffic in the honored (at least among some) traditions of exaggeration, misdirection, and out-and-out lying. You study and follow the teachings of great fabulists of the past-all of them fictional, almost certainly-and apply that knowledge to your bardic skills. You transfer your natural talent for illusion and deception to your friends, granting them some small measure of glory-or so you try to convince them. </p><p><b>CUNNING PREVARICATOR PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Shrouding Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and one ally you choose within 5 squares of you become invisible until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Virtue of Deceit (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use your Bardic Virtue class feature, one ally you choose within 5 squares of you gains combat advantage against the target of his or her next attack. </p><p><b>Trickster's Mercy (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use majestic word to heal a bloodied ally, that ally becomes invisible until the start of his or her next turn. </p><p><b>CUNNING PREVARICATOR POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.iPKzerF7MU5wWXkL]{Cunning Prevaricator 11-Lying Lights}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.yGRXBDschErqJlFx]{Cunning Prevaricator 12-Trickery's Reward}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.zuaix2AbHOn31Fsl]{Cunning Prevaricator 20-Nimbus of Falsehood}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 18. </p>",

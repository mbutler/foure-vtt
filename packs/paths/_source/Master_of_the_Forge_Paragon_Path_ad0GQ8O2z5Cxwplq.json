			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Runepriest </p><p>The forge rune is a rare divine rune that few runepriests learn to master. Only by toiling at a forge for years in training can one hope to learn its secrets. You are one such runepriest. During your apprenticeship, you learned not only the mysteries of divine magic but also the subtle powers of the forge. Guided by the gods and your teachers, you crafted weapons and armor and learned to care for the spiritual and material needs of those who fight for the gods. </p><p>A master of the forge draws power from the forge rune, imbuing allies' weapons and armor with divine power. At your behest, blades slice through stone with ease, and armor deflects even a dragon's claws. </p><p>Dwarf runepriests are the most common followers of this path. The dwarven heritage of metalwork makes the forge rune a common topic of study among them. </p><p><b>MASTER OF THE FORGE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Forge Rune Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a +4 bonus to weapon damage rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Runes of the Blade Smith (11th level)</b></p><p>When you take a short or an extended rest, you can touch one weapon that you or an ally carries. That weapon then gains a +1 bonus to damage rolls until you grant this bonus to a different weapon. </p><p><b>Indomitable Steel (16th level)</b></p><p>When you take a short or an extended rest, you can touch one suit of heavy armor that you or an ally wears. That armor gains a +1 bonus to AC until you grant this bonus to a different suit of armor. </p><p><b>MASTER OF THE FORGE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.hOGueL317S8JwtE4]{Master of the Forge 11-Call of Iron}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.06WlAqUQEM7TsDpJ]{Master of the Forge 12-Blessing of the Forge}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.mVOiYyX7f9AUW8s5]{Master of the Forge 20-Fury of the Forge}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 114. </p>",

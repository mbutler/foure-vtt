You grow stronger both in your connection to the primal spirits and in your martial prowess. This marriage of power makes you a dangerous and skilled warrior when in control of your emotions, and a force of nature when you give in to your rage. </p><p><b>DEADLY BERSERKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Berserker's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a melee weapon attack, you deal 1d12 extra damage to each target you hit with that attack. </p><p><b>Reaping Fury (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are under the effect of your Berserker Fury class feature, whenever you miss with a weapon using an at-will attack power or an encounter attack power, you gain a power bonus to the damage roll of your next weapon attack that hits before the end of your next turn. The bonus equals your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Supreme Stamina (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever your attack drops a nonminion enemy to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + one-half your level. </p><p><b>DEADLY BERSERKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.rYRum2NfOHU7Pzd5]{Deadly Berserker 11-A Thousand Ways to Die}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.uU1G25Tl8e3Wjfpk]{Deadly Berserker 12-Surge of Strength}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.U0YnCckbfPRr2wE5]{Deadly Berserker 20-Slake the Rage}</p><p>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 116. </p>",

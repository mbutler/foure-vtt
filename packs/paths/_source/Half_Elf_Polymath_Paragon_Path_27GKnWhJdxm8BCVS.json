			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Half-elf </p><p>You have a trick that none of your enemies expect you to have. It has come in handy time and again, making you wonder what other skills you might learn to further confound your foes. </p><p>You begin by practicing your trick to make it more powerful and even faster to perform. Eventually, you realize that your allies provide instruction in a variety of ways. Some might call what you do imitation, but that barely scratches the surface of the relationship you have with your allies. You can become one of your allies, if only for a moment, and use his or her power as your own. Only the choice of allies you keep around you limits your range of options, and you can take advantage of each ally's strengths to defeat your common foes. </p><p><b>HALF-ELF POLYMATH PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dabbler Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point and use the extra action to use the power you gained from your Dilettante racial trait, you can move your speed or shift 1 square before or after you resolve the extra action. </p><p><b>Well-Rounded (11th level)</b></p><p>Choose any two skills in which you are not trained. You become trained in those skills. </p><p><b>Broad Dilettante (16th level)</b></p><p>Choose a 1st-level at-will attack power from any class that is different from yours. You gain that power. </p><p><b>HALF-ELF POLYMATH POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.UZQejJP279rnOGIR]{Half-Elf Polymath 11-Practiced Dilettante}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.XgMnWrGAuE5skJKi]{Half-Elf Polymath 12-Skill Dabbler}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.cCR0DeK5BhsONToW]{Half-Elf Polymath 20-Infinite Reflections}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 69. </p>",

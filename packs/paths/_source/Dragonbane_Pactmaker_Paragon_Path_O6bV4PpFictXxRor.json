			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock </p><p>Dragons are ubiquitous. They dwell in every known world, in every known environment. They exist even amongst the fey, among the fiends, and among the stars. You have entered into a second compact with an entity that despises all that is draconic, and it has granted you the ability to more effectively combat dragons. </p><p><b>DRAGONBANE PACTMAKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Dragonbane Boon (11th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain a +1 bonus to your Reflex defense until the end of your next turn. If that creature is a dragon, you instead gain a +3 bonus to your Reflex defense. </p><p><b>Dragonbane Curse (16th level)</b></p><p>An enemy under your Warlock's Curse that hits or misses you takes 1 point of damage. If the enemy is a dragon, it instead takes damage equal to your Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>DRAGONBANE PACTMAKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.DtbZL0eMsF9Civnk]{Dragonbane Pactmaker 11-Breath-Disrupting Blast}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.iTSgd7InK26j9aDm]{Dragonbane Pactmaker 12-Ride the Burning Wind}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.vnDCqdopxuVcYRjL]{Dragonbane Pactmaker 20-Fearsome Gaze}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 51. </p>",

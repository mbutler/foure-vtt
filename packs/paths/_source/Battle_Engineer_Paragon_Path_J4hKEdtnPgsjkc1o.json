These artificers were battle engineers, and they carried their skills into battle. Battle engineers proved a vital addition to the armies of the Last War. Today, those who follow in the battle engineers' tradition are also formidable fighting companions. </p><p><b>BATTLE ENGINEER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Aggressive Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls until the end of your next turn, and your weapon attacks deal 1d6 extra damage until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Brutal Enchantment (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever one of your artificer or battle engineer powers grants an ally a bonus to weapon damage rolls, that ally's weapon also becomes brutal 1 until the bonus ends.

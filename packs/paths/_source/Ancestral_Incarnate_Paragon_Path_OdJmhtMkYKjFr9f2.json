			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Deva </p><p>All devas have at least a tenuous connection to their past lives, and they see themselves as spiritual descendants of their previous incarnations. For you, the connection to your past lives is more tangible. As an ancestral incarnate, you can call forth your own spirit as it existed years or centuries ago to advise you, protect you, and confound your enemies. Those who have the temerity to face you in battle learn that they aren't fighting just the present-day incarnation of you, but also every incarnation of you that has ever been. </p><p><b>ANCESTRAL INCARNATE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Resurgent Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can regain the use of an encounter attack power that you have already used during this encounter. The power's level must be no higher than your level -4, and you must use the power when taking the extra action. </p><p><b>Serene Countenance (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws to end effects that make you dazed or stunned. </p><p><b>Past-Life Acolytes (16th level)</b></p><p>When you perform any ritual, you can make three ghostly incarnations of your past lives step out of your body to help you. Each incarnation either grants you a +2 bonus to the ritual's skill check or contributes a healing surge to help pay the ritual's healing surge cost, if any. The number of incarnations increases to four at 20th level, five at 25th level, and six at 30th level. </p><p><b>ANCESTRAL INCARNATE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.JNXLPRF37DrAnble]{Ancestral Incarnate 11-Past-Life Guardian}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.73RKtI5LjgxrEBsy]{Ancestral Incarnate 12-Past-Life Servant}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.W8ET0gj6x4hRbHoa]{Ancestral Incarnate 20-Past-Life Vanguard}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 19. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric </p><p>Many of the gods harbor a special hatred for dragons, or at least those dragons who do not share their alignment </p><p>and worldview. They have not forgotten Io's arrogance, his refusal to work alongside them in their battle against the Primordials. As such, when a cleric devotes herself to battling these monstrous creatures, many of the gods have provided ceremonies and rites to imbue that cleric with extra powers. When you use your Scourge of Io powers, your eyes briefly take on slitted pupils and a gleam of inner power. </p><p><b>SCOURGE OF IO PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Draconic Anathema (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a new special power you can use with your Channel Divinity class feature, allowing you power over dragons similar to that which other clerics have over undead. You are still limited to one use of Channel Divinity per encounter. </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Wyrm-Bane (16th level)</b></p><p>Dragons take a -2 penalty to saving throws against conditions that you create. </p><p><b>SCOURGE OF IO POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.5Ow8vVRLgjoGKQBX]{Scourge of Io 11-Wrath upon Dragons}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.nvTGl7RUz4eM8EJd]{Scourge of Io 12-Primal Bottle}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.jVgfRyGSnUEeWTpN]{Scourge of Io 20-Fire with Fire}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 47. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Hospitality feat </p><p>As a sanctuary guardian, you are the point of the spear for House Ghallanda, adept at enforcing the house's mandate to provide a safe haven for its guests. House Ghallanda has enclaves around the world that are beset by hazards such as overzealous local authorities, kidnappers, and rampaging monsters. You've been trained to deal with all such threats. Through the power of your dragon mark, you set the stage for battles, making sure that your allies have the advantage. Your powers help keep your allies fighting and your enemies struggling. Those who would challenge you or your comrades quickly learn that House Ghallanda is competent in more arts than just those of comfort and convenience. </p><p><b>GHALLANDA SANCTUARY GUARDIAN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Hospitable Surge (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend a healing surge, each ally adjacent to you can make a saving throw.

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Runepriest </p><p>You see in the runes a strength greater than that of any mortal power, and you maintain a stern resolution to bring the power of the gods to bear on those who would threaten the world and the astral domains. The first rune of shielding remains carved into the stone at the heart of the world, where members of your order delved into the darkest shadows to defeat primordials of earth and lava. Someday you might make a pilgrimage to that sacred place, but until then you stand at the forefront of any battle. Your runes echo across the battlefield, scattering your foes and fortifying your allies. </p><p>As a rune shield, you master a series of secret runes that allow you to cloak your allies in a protective sphere of divine magic. The runes have such power that merely speaking them turns aside arrows, knocks swords and axes away from your friends, and blunts your enemies' most reckless charge. </p><p><b>RUNE SHIELD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Guardian Shield (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you enter a new rune state, you can enter the rune state of the iron shield instead. While you are in this rune state, each ally gains a +2 bonus to all defenses while adjacent to you. This rune state ends when you move. </p><p><b>Protective Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each ally you can see gains a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn. </p><p><b>Mighty Guardian (16th level)</b></p><p>The bonus to all defenses granted by your Guardian Shield path feature increases to 4. </p><p><b>RUNE SHIELD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.vYsfNqHhZXRog1xQ]{Rune Shield 11-Battering Rune}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.qiDBjkRueV9ZNdcS]{Rune Shield 12-Rune of Shielding (Rune Shield)}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ODQhHXiwNerKWd7J]{Rune Shield 20-Hounding Shield of Radiance}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 115. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian, trained in Nature </p><p>The wilderness is your home, and your connection to the primal spirits of the land grants you speed and ferocity. You move through the forest like a deer, and you charge into battle with the cheetah's speed and fury. </p><p>The powers of a wildrunner emphasize mobility, letting you shift and move quickly while striking your foes. You pounce from foe to foe, avoiding opportunity attacks while dealing all the damage your rage can muster. </p><p>Elf barbarians are frequently drawn to this paragon path, because its powers complement their natural mobility. Likewise, many rangers who nurture a connection to the primal forces of nature by taking barbarian multiclass feats find this path appealing. </p><p><b>WILDRUNNER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Hunter's Fury (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a melee attack, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Strength modifier after the attack. </p><p><b>Wildrunner's Swiftness (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to your speed, or a +2 bonus while you are raging. </p><p><b>Wild Resilience (16th level)</b></p><p>While you are raging, you gain a +2 bonus to saving throws. </p><p><b>WILDRUNNER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.a30puUz9ksCVNKJQ]{Wildrunner 11-Shifting Wilds Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3UJ0kWQC4NZzmME1]{Wildrunner 12-Press the Kill}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3Pws21DBQI7YhL0U]{Wildrunner 20-Wildrunner's Rage}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 65. </p>",

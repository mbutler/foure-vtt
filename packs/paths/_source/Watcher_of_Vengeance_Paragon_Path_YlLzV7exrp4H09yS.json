			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Avenger, trained in Insight or Perception </p><p>Evil wears many masks, adopts many guises, but you make it your business to peer through the illusions and see things as they truly are. You skulk through the shadows, blending into the night to observe the guilty and learn their secrets. Each word and each action reveals strengths and weaknesses, giving you the tools to overcome them when the time is right to strike. </p><p><b>WATCHER OF VENGEANCE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Vengeful Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy you have combat advantage against hits an ally you can see, you can spend an action point as an immediate interrupt to make a basic attack against that enemy. If the attack hits, you deal an extra 2d6 damage. </p><p><b>Watcher's Insight (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Insight, Perception, and Stealth checks. You also gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against charm, fear, and illusion effects. </p><p><b>Witnessed Weakness (16th level)</b></p><p>When you have any concealment or cover and an enemy misses you with an attack, you gain combat advantage against that enemy until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>WATCHER OF VENGEANCE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.s8FDaiRAUWBm1wcq]{Watcher of Vengeance 11-Hidden Danger}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RT69tm2Lf10XKzVo]{Watcher of Vengeance 12-Clarity of Purpose}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.H7CsUY2Gb1LoqDjM]{Watcher of Vengeance 20-Just Punishment}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 377, page(s) 48. </p>",

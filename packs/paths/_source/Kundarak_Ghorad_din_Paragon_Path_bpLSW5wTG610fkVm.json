			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Warding feat </p><p>You are part of an unusual group of thieves. You are a member of House Kundarak's Ghorad'din, who are charged with testing the house's wards and recovering property stolen by those brazen enough to break into Kundarak vaults. You combine the magical prowess of a spellcaster with the stealth of a burglar. As a result, no barrier can stop you. </p><p>House Kundarak uses the Ghorad'din only rarely, and they answer only to Lord Morrikan, leader of House Kundarak. When a new high security vault needs testing, the house assembles a group of Ghorad'din to try to break in and expose weaknesses before any treasure is placed within. Although such practices hone your skills, you might prefer even greater challenges. The most skilled Ghorad'din are assigned to recover stolen property from other gifted thieves. Whispers also tell of Ghorad'din who operate as assassins. </p><p><b>KUNDARAK GHORAD'DIN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Careful Trap-Breaker (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +5 bonus to Thievery checks to delay a trap, and you do not trigger a trap with a failed Thievery check. </p><p><b>Ghorad'din Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to Thievery checks and Stealth checks until the end of your next turn. You also gain a +2 bonus to AC and to Reflex until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Master Burglar (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you make a Thievery check, you roll two dice and take the higher result. </p><p><b>KUNDARAK GHORAD'DIN POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.DQjIuEJ83BqdRyUL]{Kundarak Ghorad'din 11-Befuddling Bypass}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.1RFS6KCHUcduIWBv]{Kundarak Ghorad'din 12-Thwart the Walls}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.unOimr5BqFDT2AtX]{Kundarak Ghorad'din 20-Ward Unleashed}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 71. </p>",

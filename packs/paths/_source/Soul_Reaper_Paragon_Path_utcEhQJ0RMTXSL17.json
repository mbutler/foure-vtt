It is not an end, of course, but a beginning-the first step onto the road into the unknown. For you, death offers little fear or concern because you are confident that the Raven Queen will shepherd you to whatever fate your long service has earned. This comfort and understanding forms the cornerstone of your beliefs, and you carry this message wherever you go, consoling the grieving or speeding those who deserve to meet the Raven Queen on their way. </p><p><b>SOUL REAPER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Disrupting Attack (11th level)</b></p><p>You ignore necrotic resistance with your divine attack powers. </p><p><b>Harvesting Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action on a turn in which you reduced a non-minion enemy to 0 hit points, you can also move your speed as a free action. </p><p><b>Drawn to Death (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever a creature within 5 squares of you reduces another creature to 0 hit points or fewer, you can shift 2 squares toward the triggering creature. </p><p><b>SOUL REAPER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.WoOS2tMNuq7U1Yir]{Soul Reaper 11-Grave Chill}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.254DHzJkqmbWufLn]{Soul Reaper 12-Fated Outcome}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.6Y4ZNOXKIViFQLWS]{Soul Reaper 20-Call of Letherna}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 63. </p>",

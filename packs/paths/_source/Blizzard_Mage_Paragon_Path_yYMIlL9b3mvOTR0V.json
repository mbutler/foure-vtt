			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer </p><p>In the frozen wastes, and in the frost-blasted fields of winter, you feel at home. You find the cold, harsh conditions hospitable, even comforting. You can pull winter storms from across the world, or even from the Elemental Chaos, and use them to ruin your enemies. When you attack, your body is covered with ice crystals, and your skin pales. Your spells fill the air around you with blowing snow or hail, and powerful winds whip up. </p><p>The blizzard is your best friend and your most ferocious servitor. With its aid, you move creatures about inside killing blasts and knock them down with freezing vortexes of driving snow and ice. </p><p>Is it any wonder that your heart has grown cold, too? It is up to you whether your nature grows more and more aloof like the bleak season you embody, or whether your heart yet shelters a warm hearth for those you name friend. </p><p><b>BLIZZARD MAGE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Icy Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point to make an attack, each creature you hit or miss with the attack is slowed (save ends). </p><p><b>Walk through Winter (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are immobilized, you can shift 1 square. While you are slowed, your speed is 3 instead of 2. </p><p><b>Chill Winds (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit, you can slide any single creature within 10 squares of you 1 square. </p><p><b>BLIZZARD MAGE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.nC6F7XBG5Yps8jvr]{Blizzard Mage 11-Winter's Clutch}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.MQazsRNioY2lfIt6]{Blizzard Mage 12-Cloak of Freezing Wind}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.N0t6h9IJg7EGHVfn]{Blizzard Mage 20-Blizzard}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 42. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Avenger, oath of enmity power </p><p>Walking unseen among a thankless populace are agents of the Unbroken Circle-a unity of avengers in service to the goddess Erathis. Each agent is sworn to root out and destroy forces that foul the goodness of mortal hearts. They wage a constant war against growing evil, defending civilization and the honor of Nerath from the closing jaws of tyranny and corruption. </p><p>As an agent of the Unbroken Circle, you take on corruption wherever you find it-and since you actively look for it, you find a great deal of it. Whether you're based in a population center and spend most of your time there or travel far afield in search of those who have fallen morally and ethically, you rely on your skills as an avenger and the ones you gain as an agent to handle combat situations and provide support to those with whom you travel. Due to your constant vigilance for signs of corruption, you have found few you can trust, and you always formulate an escape plan in every situation, just in case the ones you rely upon fail you. </p><p><b>AGENT OF THE UNBROKEN CIRCLE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Incorruptible (11th level)</b></p><p>You become trained in the Insight and Streetwise skills. </p><p><b>Unity Unbroken (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, until the end of your next turn your allies gain a +5 bonus to damage rolls against your oath of enmity target while they are flanking that target. </p><p><b>Exorcise Corruption (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit against your oath of enmity target, each ally within 10 squares of your target that can see the target can make a saving throw, with a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p><p><b>AGENT OF THE UNBROKEN CIRCLE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9LfAZ8nSi5mtqBa3]{Agent of the Unbroken Circle 11-Carve Out Corruption}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.DEZphMHNqaRCQiIY]{Agent of the Unbroken Circle 12-Sanctity of the Ring}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.CTlzNEH4Jruo5ZV9]{Agent of the Unbroken Circle 20-Judgment of the True King}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 387, page(s) 38. </p>",

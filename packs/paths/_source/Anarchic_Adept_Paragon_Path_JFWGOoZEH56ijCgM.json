			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ardent </p><p>As your psionic talent matures, you find yourself focusing on the disparate nature of the disciplines you master. Focusing your thought on the edge of unpredictability in your training, you discover the latent chaos flowing through your magic. Through trial and error, you learned to master the chaos latent within your powers and unleash it against your enemies. Drawing on the power of chaos can be dangerous, but you are up to any risk you might face. </p><p><b>ANARCHIC ADEPT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Anarchic Surge (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use ardent surge, roll a d6. If you roll an even number, the target of ardent surge can also teleport 2 squares as a free action. If you roll an odd number, add the die result to the hit points the target regains. </p><p><b>Chaotic Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you can choose to bestow the power of chaos onto one ally adjacent to you or adjacent to any target of the attack.

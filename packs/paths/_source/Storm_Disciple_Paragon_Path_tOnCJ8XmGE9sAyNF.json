			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind </p><p>Your philosophy of life and battle is shaped by your belief in the infinite storm. In every corner of the world and every part of the planes, order and chaos contend for domination. Violent storms of elemental fury are the most potent sign of this struggle. At no time is all the cosmos ever at peace. Through study and diligence, you draw power from these infinite and endless storms, channeling their destructive fury. You represent the infinite storm in your travels, welcoming the violence that is a constant part of life. Like the power of the storm, you are everywhere. </p><p><b>STORM DISCIPLE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Lightning's Path Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you teleport 5 squares.

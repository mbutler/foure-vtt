			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shadar-kai </p><p>The crowing moot of the shadar-kai is your playground, where your myth is in the making. Your accomplishments are known among your peers and written indelibly on your body. Words have you woven before your equals and lessers, telling the story of what you have done and where you have gone. Ever have you emerged undefeated. Doubt you've rebuffed with proof, perhaps even a gory show of strength. In the face of your enemies, you speak of their last moments and your inevitable victory. Maybe you even learn all you can about your greatest foes, telling them how the twisted path of history has led them into your reach and, ultimately, to doom. You have mastered the art of crowing to the level of the mystical. Oaths and boasts you make carry with them the fearsome shadow of fate. Adversaries quail before your bold speech, and your allies know what you say is a promise, not a hope. You're proof that bragging isn't really bragging if what you say is true. </p><p><b>DOOMSPEAKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Fearmonger (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you make an attack with a power that has the Rattling keyword, the target still suffers the Rattling effect even if your attack misses. </p><p><b>Rattling Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point to make an extra attack, the attack power you use is considered to have the Rattling keyword. </p><p><b>Thrive on Fear (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use a power that has the Rattling keyword and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you can immediately spend a healing surge as a free action. </p><p><b>DOOMSPEAKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.xtHQ7R3EPB01IqLd]{Doomspeaker 11-Unnerving Boast}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.JrEiwmOfkXNyB9bc]{Doomspeaker 12-Quickened Coercion}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eB9y5p8GWmIcVU4i]{Doomspeaker 20-Doomcaller's Promise}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 372, page(s) 14. </p>",

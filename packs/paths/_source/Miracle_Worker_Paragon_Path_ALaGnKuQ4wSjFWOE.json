			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Cleric, trained in Heal </p><p>You've always had a knack for the healing arts. People just seem to recover more quickly under your care: Bones knit and cuts mend quickly, and even sickness flees your touch. As your mastery of divine power has strengthened, so too have your skills at tending the sick and injured. Now life energy flows through your fingertips to anyone you attend. </p><p>More than other clerics, you commit your life to alleviating suffering in any form. When you are not adventuring, you might work in the temples of any god and lend your talents to help the community, whether supplying food to the hungry or removing sickness from the afflicted. You bring these same sensibilities to an adventuring group. You move across the battlefield to shore up weakness and patch up the wounded so they can get back into the fight. You might not directly share in the glory enjoyed by your companions, but you take heart in knowing that they couldn't have done it without you. </p><p><b>MIRACLE WORKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Miracle Worker Healing Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to use a divine healing power, each ally adjacent to you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier. The hit points regained increase to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level. </p><p><b>Word of Life (Miracle Worker) (11th level)</b></p><p>Increase your healing surge value by your Intelligence or Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>Aura of Health (16th level)</b></p><p>When an ally within 5 squares of you uses his or her second wind, that ally regains 3d6 additional hit points. </p><p><b>MIRACLE WORKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.h4oSDL2bciMVwPOe]{Miracle Worker 11-Reversal of Fortunes}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.gXTF7DBzLRQuO6yi]{Miracle Worker 12-Miraculous Grace}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.OUVTcKzbWJXAuYMR]{Miracle Worker 20-Reap What You Sow}</p><p>Published in Divine Power, page(s) 50. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Tiefling, any martial class </p><p>Bael Turath left more than ruins in its wake. Knowledge was also its legacy. No society reaches such great heights without creating great works of architecture, art, magic, and-most importantly-war. Adventurers, scholars, and enthusiasts have long sought the martial secrets taken for granted by the nobles of that infernal empire. </p><p>You know one of those secrets: a long-forgotten style of martial combat devised specifically for tieflings, drawing upon their mental faculties and unique physicality to perform amazing stunts. Your study of the Way of the Hell-Kite has granted you a deeper understanding of your body's capabilities and the ability to surpass its limitations. </p><p><b>TURATHI HELL-KITE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Tail Sweep Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a melee attack, each enemy adjacent to the target of the attack is knocked prone if you hit or miss. </p><p><b>Turathi Tenacity (11th level)</b></p><p>Add your Intelligence or Charisma modifier to your healing surge value. In addition, you gain an extra healing surge. </p><p><b>Turathi Vigor (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use infernal wrath, you gain temporary hit points equal to 10 + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>TURATHI HELL-KITE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dTwgkU4raiQAYfC3]{Turathi Hell-Kite 11-Hell's Ram}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.OlC0sGdERLiPUg58]{Turathi Hell-Kite 12-Ride the Devil's Tail}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.G8S2k9VrhEO0sXyb]{Turathi Hell-Kite 20-Flame Blade}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook Races: Tiefling, page(s) 17. </p>",

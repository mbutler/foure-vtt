			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard class, proficiency with longsword </p><p>You have decided to adopt the traditions of the Spiral Tower, the arcane teachings of the followers of Corellon. This links your use of arcane power firmly to the Feywild and the arcane-focused eladrin traditions. As a wizard of the Spiral Tower, Corellon's longsword becomes your arcane implement and the secrets of the Feywild become pages in your spellbook. As a wizard of the Spiral Tower, you carry a longsword that glows with the arcane beauty of the Feywild. </p><p><b>WIZARD OF THE SPIRAL TOWER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Corellon's Implement (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain proficiency with the longsword as an implement. In addition, if you have the Arcane Implement Mastery class feature, the benefits you gain from that feature for one implement, such as a staff or a wand, can be used with a longsword. </p><p><b>Spiral Tower Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to regain the use of one wizard encounter attack power that you have already used during this encounter, instead of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Radiant Censure (16th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy attacks your Will, the enemy takes radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). </p><p><b>WIZARD OF THE SPIRAL TOWER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.1HZpGzsLeb7qrTa0]{Wizard of the Spiral Tower 11-The One Sword}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.OF2cGnUfJMteV0hX]{Wizard of the Spiral Tower 12-Shape the Dream}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.CNnOTfRQy36rYPbc]{Wizard of the Spiral Tower 20-Corellon's Blade}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 171, Class Compendium. </p>",

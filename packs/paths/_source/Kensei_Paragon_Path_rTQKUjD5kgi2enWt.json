Together, you represent a combination of destruction that few foes can long stand against. </p><p><b>KENSEI PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Kensei Control Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll one attack roll, damage roll, skill check, or ability check, instead of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Kensei Focus (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls with a melee weapon of your choice. </p><p><b>Kensei Mastery (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls with the same weapon you selected for Kensei Focus. If you ever use a different kind of weapon, you lose this benefit, and the benefit of Kensei Focus, until you take a short rest, during which time you reattune yourself to your chosen weapon with a short meditation. </p><p><b>KENSEI POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SXNjRyJTFmdrM4LB]{Kensei 11-Masterstroke}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Dn8FEPhHBUWjsGgK]{Kensei 12-Ultimate Parry}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.J4baYvifAZzIWG8s]{Kensei 20-Weaponsoul Dance}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 87, Class Compendium. </p>",

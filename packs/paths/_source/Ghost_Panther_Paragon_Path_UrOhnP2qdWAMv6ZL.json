			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shaman, call spirit companion power </p><p>The mystery of the primal stalker is that death is a constant presence in the midst of life; the death of the prey brings life to the predator. And when death comes to the predator, it brings life to scavengers and carrion feeders. Death is part of the great wheel of mortal existence, and an important part of the shaman's communion with the spirit world. </p><p>As a shaman, you have always walked close to death. Now you have set out on the path of the ghost panther, where life and death twine together still closer. You stalk the wild, hiding from your prey, leaping and climbing like the most agile of cats. You call on panther spirits to attack your foes, weaken your prey, help you leap away from enemy attacks, and lead you through the spirit world to teleport adjacent to your foes. </p><p><b>GHOST PANTHER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Ghost Panther Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each enemy adjacent to your spirit companion grants combat advantage to you and your allies until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Ghost Panther's Wisdom (11th level)</b></p><p>You and your allies gain a +5 power bonus to Stealth checks while adjacent to your spirit companion. </p><p><b>Panther Ancestors (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a bonus to Acrobatics, Athletics, and Stealth checks equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p><p><b>GHOST PANTHER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.zZKpX4xhMgak5srv]{Ghost Panther 11-Predator Spirit}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.8EcDxUjXBVmNPwOk]{Ghost Panther 12-Great Cat's Dodge}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9LzcnZdxC2QhGk5r]{Ghost Panther 20-Ghost Panther Spiral}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 133. </p>",

The power of the planes draws you almost as strongly as your own arcane strength pulls the creatures you call to your side. You form a stronger link than others with the creatures you summon, granting you increased control over them. This closer communication even allows you to manipulate the boundaries between planes. You are a beneficent master, though, and you imbue your summoned servants with greater vitality-in exchange for even more dedicated service. </p><p><b>BONDED SUMMONER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Summoner's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, as a free action you can issue one minor action command to each of your summoned creatures. </p><p><b>Summoner's Slip (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use an arcane power that has the conjuration or summoning keyword, you can teleport 2 squares as a free action after using the power. </p><p><b>Summoner's Might (16th level)</b></p><p>Creatures you summon gain regeneration 10. </p><p><b>BONDED SUMMONER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.b4rlAgqFyNecWYnP]{Bonded Summoner 11-Planar Gateway}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.TlNf149KdSumtJQk]{Bonded Summoner 12-Enduring Summons}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.IXhEzqsrLl59gfCJ]{Bonded Summoner 20-Summon Bonded Protector}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 117. </p>",

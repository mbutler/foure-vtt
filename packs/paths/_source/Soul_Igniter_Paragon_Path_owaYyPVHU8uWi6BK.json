			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shaman, call spirit companion power </p><p>The essence of fire is the essence of potential. Even the smallest flame can become a raging conflagration, capable of consuming everything in its path. Fire is an unstoppable force unmatched by almost anything else in the primal world. Likewise, the spirit of flame has the capability to consume everything it touches, growing with and reshaping the world around it. However, every fire spirit starts small; only with fuel can it grow. </p><p>As a soul igniter, you imbue the physical being with fiery spirits, providing a limitless supply of fuel for these powerful forces. This imbued spirit is called Soulfire, and it allows your allies to move at the speed of a raging wildfire while enhancing their blows with burning spiritual flames. As you grow in power, your spirit companion also becomes a stronger conduit for the spirit of flame, capable of unleashing scorching fury at your enemies. </p><p><b>SOUL IGNITER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Soulfire (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain the soulfire power. </p><p><b>Soulfire Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point, you can use your soulfire power as a free action, targeting yourself and two allies in range. </p><p><b>Fiery Spirit (16th level)</b></p><p>If a melee or ranged attack deals damage to your spirit companion and causes it to disappear, your spirit deals 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier fire damage to each enemy adjacent to it. </p><p><b>SOUL IGNITER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.rS46ChFiJ5guGw0b]{Soul Igniter 11-Soul Flare}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Xfg1IcDVRaN2hyOQ]{Soul Igniter 12-Soul Furnace}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.18sGQPNJzHlb7ERv]{Soul Igniter 20-Spirit Detonation}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 37. </p>",

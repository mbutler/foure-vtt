Exploring your heritage and testing its limits increases your personal power as well as your ability to command the magic flowing from the Elemental Chaos. The more you grow in power, the stronger the plane's hold on you becomes. </p><p><b>REFORGED SOUL PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Chaos-Touched (11th level)</b></p><p>At the end of each extended rest, roll a d10 and consult the following table. You gain resist 10 to the damage type you rolled, and your reforged soul attack powers gain this damage type. The benefit lasts until the end of your next extended rest. </p><p><table><tr><td> </td><td> </td> </tr><tr><td>1-2 </td><td>Acid </td> </tr><tr><td>3-4 </td><td>Cold </td> </tr><tr><td>5-6 </td><td>Fire </td> </tr><tr><td>7-8 </td><td>Lightning </td> </tr><tr><td>9-10 </td><td>Thunder </td> </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Surging Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an extra attack, that attack deals 1d6 extra damage if it is a close or area attack, or 1d10 extra damage if it is a melee or ranged attack. This extra damage has a damage type matching the type you rolled for your Chaos-Touched feature. The extra damage increases to 2d6 and 2d10 at 21st level. </p><p><b>Embraced by Chaos (16th level)</b></p><p>You roll twice and use both results when you use your Chaos-Touched feature. When you get a duplicate result, choose any other damage type instead. </p><p>You are also able to speak, read, and write Primordial fluently. </p><p><b>REFORGED SOUL POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.tYAfa4iLQlqR9MdE]{Reforged Soul 11-Elemental Cascade}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9dDwMku8FZXVbciI]{Reforged Soul 12-Flowing Chaos}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.78szTnDNVpPAx3EM]{Reforged Soul 20-Elemental Flood}</p><p>Published in Heroes of the Elemental Chaos, page(s) 136. </p>",

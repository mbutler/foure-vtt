			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>You raise your eyes and heart to the stars and to the spirit of the shining, winged serpents that helped tame the primordials. You have chosen the couatl as a spiritual ally, embracing that legendary creature's power so thoroughly that you assume its very form. You emulate your shining ally by rising above the battle with a flourish of power or by passing through your enemies like a radiant spirit. </p><p>Like couatls, you understand the necessity of sacrifice. The coils of your power can trap enemies that would otherwise harm your allies, but you must be willing to take those allies' hurts on yourself. If your own survival is jeopardized as you protect your friends, so be it. </p><p><b>RADIANT SERPENT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Radiant Glow (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain radiant resistance equal to one-half your level and a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects that immobilize or restrain you. In addition, whenever you take radiant damage, your attacks deal extra radiant damage equal to one-half your level until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Radiant Serpent Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action while you are in any guardian form, you become insubstantial and gain phasing and a fly speed equal to your speed until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Mantle of Sacrifice (16th level)</b></p><p>When you score a critical hit against an enemy, that enemy cannot attack any target except you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>RADIANT SERPENT POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.0vMjVYPFAdh6uGf8]{Radiant Serpent 11-Radiant Coils}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.nlLMseWrZGRiNKhy]{Radiant Serpent 12-Shining Pass}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.WNl1jfAX6HkTZIgE]{Radiant Serpent 20-Form of the Radiant Couatl}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 112. </p>",

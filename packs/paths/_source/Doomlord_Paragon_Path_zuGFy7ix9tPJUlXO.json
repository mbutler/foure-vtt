			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ironwrought theme, or proficiency with scale armor and a military melee weapon </p><p>From brooding fortresses in the Elemental Chaos, the Doomguard watches the decay of the cosmos and its unstoppable slide into dissolution. These stoic warriors believe the universe's fate was sealed when the gods defeated the primordials, because imprisoning these entities kept them from sustaining the world and thus doomed it. The Doomlords are the Doomguard's champions, warriors aligned against those who espouse order and perpetuate corrupt and tyrannical regimes. As is true of their cousins, the Doomguard Marauders (Manual of the Planes), the ranks of the Doomlords include both valiant champions of freedom and murderous anarchists. </p><p><b>DOOMLORD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Doomlord's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to deal 1d10 + your highest ability modifier necrotic damage to each creature adjacent to you, instead of taking an extra action. Each creature damaged in this way then gains vulnerable 5 necrotic until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Entropic Surge (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend a healing surge to regain hit points, you can choose to reduce the hit points regained by half your surge value to instead gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Entropic Harbinger (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain the entropic harbinger power. </p><p><b>DOOMLORD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.iDnokAR3lKIzNcZ6]{Doomlord 11-Entropy Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.smWGXy0bkTaP2Rwq]{Doomlord 12-Doomlord's Advance}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.i4LJ7pMGxvyT0tQ9]{Doomlord 16-Entropic Harbinger}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.StswmlUpP39vnh2E]{Doomlord 20-Hasten the End}</p><p>Published in Heroes of the Elemental Chaos, page(s) 123. </p>",

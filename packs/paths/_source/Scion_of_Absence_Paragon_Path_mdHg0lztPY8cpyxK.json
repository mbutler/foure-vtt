			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Genasi, voidsoul elemental manifestation </p><p>What is, the void consumes. To attack the void is of the utmost futility, because it has no point of weakness, no vulnerability, and nothing to sever or destroy. </p><p>The scion of absence studies and learns from the voidsoul association with the inverted fundament: the lack of all things. Most are philosophic warriors or masters of magic, seeking the nonaction that achieves their goals. Others resemble destructive forces of nature that no one can easily stop. </p><p><b>SCION OF ABSENCE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Nonbeing Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can end one effect you currently have that a save can end. Also, you regain use of your void assumption power if you have expended it this encounter. </p><p><b>Touching the Void (11th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy misses you with an attack, it takes psychic damage equal to your Strength modifier or your Intelligence modifier. </p><p><b>Void Phase (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws. </p><p><b>SCION OF ABSENCE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SHpl2rV9kFBPuYAT]{Scion of Absence 11-Glimpse of the Void}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.zPKDSFZ6VUbiC9vQ]{Scion of Absence 12-Wearing the Void}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.sHm8yJQEKN42vcpV]{Scion of Absence 20-Voidsoul Infliction}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 22. </p>",

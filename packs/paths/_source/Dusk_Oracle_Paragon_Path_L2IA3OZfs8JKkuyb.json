			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Training in Insight and Religion </p><p>The spirits of the dead hold the accumulated lore of all creatures that once lived. Through the art of the dusk oracle, you have learned to call forth the ephemeral shades of the dead to answer questions and help you battle your foes. Whether you are a character capable of tapping into these endless memories or an empathic mortal called upon by the gods, your search for knowledge is guided by the whispers of the dead. </p><p><b>DUSK ORACLE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Foreseen Hit (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain the foreseen hit power. </p><p><b>Oracle's Insight (11th level)</b></p><p>You can ask the corpse of any intelligent creature a single question and receive an answer. The corpse knows what the creature knew in life and what has occurred near the area where its body fell. The corpse answers truthfully, though sometimes cryptically. </p><p><b>Predicted Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, the attack is against the lowest of each target's Fortitude, Reflex, or Will. If you spend an action point to take an action that grants an attack to an ally, you can apply this benefit to the ally instead of to yourself. </p><p><b>Predicted Outcome (12th level)</b></p><p>You gain the predicted outcome power. </p><p><b>Oracular Insight (16th level)</b></p><p>While you have combat advantage against an enemy, any resistance it has against your attacks is reduced by 10. </p><p><b>Foreseen Battle (20th level)</b></p><p>You gain the foreseen battle power. </p><p><b>DUSK ORACLE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.UHjXkaM0D8VF4RzW]{Dusk Oracle 11-Foreseen Hit}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.xbYsUiJjyOM3X2IL]{Dusk Oracle 12-Predicted Outcome}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.XT30CtR6y5o8Y9wS]{Dusk Oracle 20-Foreseen Battle}</p><p>Published in Heroes of Shadow, page(s) 144. </p>",

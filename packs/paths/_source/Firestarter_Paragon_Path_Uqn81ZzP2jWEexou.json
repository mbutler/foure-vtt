			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Psion </p><p>The elemental flame and arcane fire can be devastating on the battlefield, but the power of the psionic fire you wield is more deadly by far. You can scorch your enemies or scour them from the inside out. You cloak yourself in flames to protect yourself from foes as you lash them with your fiery touch. </p><p><b>FIRESTARTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Fear No Fire (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain fire resistance equal to one-half your level. </p><p><b>Force and Flame (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use a psionic force attack power, you can choose to have the power deal fire damage instead of force damage. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Wildfire Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point to take an extra action, each enemy adjacent to you takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. If you spend this action point to use a psion attack power, choose one target you hit with that attack. Each creature adjacent to that target takes fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p><p><b>Fiery Nimbus (16th level)</b></p><p>When you score a critical hit using a psionic attack power, each enemy within 2 squares of you takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you acquire a fiery nimbus until the end of the encounter. While the nimbus lasts, you gain the fiery lash power, and any creature that starts its turn adjacent to you takes fire damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. </p><p><b>FIRESTARTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.erAuXkD4g3YiGcfx]{Firestarter 11-Hungry Flames}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.g3IRh8OTdre02zZA]{Firestarter 12-Fire Walk}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.KzZvoFGrqHM1cV6j]{Firestarter 20-Spontaneous Combustion}</p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 102. </p>",

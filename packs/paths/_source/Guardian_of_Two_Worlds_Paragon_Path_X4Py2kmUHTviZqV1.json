			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>You are the guardian of two worlds. You know the perils of the wild, but you also know the corruption that dwells in the heart of civilization. Many wardens eschew civilization in favor of the purity of nature. Although you see the virtue in their point of view, you have chosen to straddle both realms in the hopes of keeping an eye on each. You know that if either becomes too dominant, neither can flourish. So you live and work, instructing people on how to interact with and be respectful of the forest, but also protecting them from deadly predators and harsh storms. </p><p><b>GUARDIAN OF TWO WORLDS PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Guardian Trick (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to gain an extra action, if you are in guardian form, you can make your guardian form attack with that action even if you have already made that attack this encounter. </p><p><b>Tangling Wild (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are in guardian form, any enemy marked by you that starts its turn adjacent to you is slowed until the end of its next turn. </p><p><b>The Warden of Both Worlds (16th level)</b></p><p>On your turn, the first time you hit an enemy marked by you, you can make one saving throw against an effect that a save can end as a free action. </p><p><b>GUARDIAN OF TWO WORLDS POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.XcvQgnmNbSuY7a3j]{Guardian of Two Worlds 11-Strike of the Sentinel}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.q3QZIkAFwVcgOfTN]{Guardian of Two Worlds 12-Stand of the Protector}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RhgElYxk53y1jdFo]{Guardian of Two Worlds 20-Form of the Stag Knight}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 379, page(s) 47. </p>",

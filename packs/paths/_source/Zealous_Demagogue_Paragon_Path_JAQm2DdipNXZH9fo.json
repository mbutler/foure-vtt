And if they don't listen and don't submit to your divine missive, then it falls to you and your allies to contain their disbelief by whatever means are necessary. </p><p><b>ZEALOUS DEMAGOGUE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Captivating Presence (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy, Insight, and Intimidate checks.

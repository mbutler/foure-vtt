			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn, any divine class </p><p>The Great Teacher was revered by all the peoples of his underground realm. The ancient adamantine dragon's influence didn't spread into the land of sun and wind, but in the rock, ore, and fungus of the Underdark, his benevolence erected an island of good under the earth. Long ago, the Great Teacher rescued a group of dragonborn that that were beset by denizens of the Underdark, and instead of returning to the surface, these dragonborn devoted themselves to the Adamantine. They became his Adamant Instructors and together they forged a noble nation around the Great Teacher's hoard in the cavern complex they called Adamanth. The dragonborn prospered under the Teacher's guidance, and Adamanth became a haven for all that was good and strong. Even some drow and duergar were drawn by the Great Teacher's benevolence to renounce their darker ways and live in peace under the rule of the Adamant Instructors. </p><p>Then one day the Great Teacher departed Adamanth to deal with a nasty group of purple dragons that were slaughtering his people on the borders of his influence. He never returned. For decades, the Adamant Instructors have followed the Great Teacher's instructions, which were carved on a disk of solid adamantine in flowing draconic script by the ancient dragon before he departed. But the Adamant Instructors are hard-pressed to keep hope alive in Adamanth. Purple worms continue to assail them, the drow are assembling an army, and rumors say that mind flayers are stirring in the deep caves to the west. In the absence of the Great Teacher, it is up to the Adamant Instructors to lead the adamantine dragon's people through these dark times. </p><p><b>ADAMANT INSTRUCTOR PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Instructed Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you and each ally within 5 squares of you gain a +2 power bonus to the next attack roll made before the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Thunderous Teachings (11th level)</b></p><p>Your dragon breath racial power deals thunder damage in addition to any damage type it might have dealt previously.

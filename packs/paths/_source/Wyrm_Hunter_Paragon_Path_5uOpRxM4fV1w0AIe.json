You might do so to protect others from their depredations, you might do so for payment, or you might simply enjoy the thrill of hunting something so powerful. Whatever your motivations, you have learned all you can about stalking and killing these horrific beasts. </p><p><b>WYRM-HUNTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon Stalker (11th level)</b></p><p>When you deal your Hunter's Quarry damage to a dragon, you deal an additional +2 damage for each die rolled. </p><p>In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on monster knowledge checks regarding dragons and on Perception checks to track dragons. </p><p><b>Dragon-Slayer's Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to reroll an attack roll against a dragon, or to end a condition currently affecting you that originated from a dragon, and that a save can end. Using this feature replaces the normal action point benefit of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Draconic Resolution (16th level)</b></p><p>When a dragon reduces an ally that you can see to 0 hit points or fewer, you can spend a healing surge. </p><p><b>WYRM-HUNTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.bYxCf75TiGX8JsHu]{Wyrm-Hunter 11-Grounding Attack}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Jn8kQ4vZ7btAzHSB]{Wyrm-Hunter 12-Into the Fire}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.wKfHn9y7R53XVGEF]{Wyrm-Hunter 20-Deadly Aim}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 369, page(s) 49. </p>",

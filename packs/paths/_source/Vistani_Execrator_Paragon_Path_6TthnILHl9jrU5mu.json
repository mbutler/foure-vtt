			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any arcane class or Covenant of Malediction class feature, Vistani Heritage </p><p>Rumor and legend speak of horrifying Vistani curses. Few are willing to put these dark parables to the test. Threat of ill fortune or a wasting disease is enough to keep the Vistani safe from numerous threats. </p><p>Folk do well to heed the folktales, because the stories are true. Of this fact you are living proof. </p><p>Although many a Vistani knows the magic to place a lasting curse on someone who has offended the clan, you are something more. In an instant, with but a glare and an oath, you can turn fortune against your adversaries. Those who dare raise their hands against you soon see the folly of their actions. </p><p>Any who show you the respect and camaraderie you deserve have little to fear. While standing beside you or watching your back, your allies benefit from the bad luck you hurl at your foes. They could even say that you bring them good fortune instead of afflicting enemies. Despite the reality, with a sly Vistani smile, you might let them believe this is true. </p><p><b>VISTANI EXECRATOR PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Cursed Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you gain combat advantage against each of your targets. </p><p><b>Sight Beyond Sight (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever an effect would blind you, you can make one saving throw to remove that effect as a free action, even if that effect doesn't normally allow a save. Additionally, you ignore concealment for any creature within 5 squares of you. </p><p><b>Master of the Vistani Curse (16th level)</b></p><p>You can use evil eye of the Vistani one additional time per encounter. </p><p><b>VISTANI EXECRATOR POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.GcUnlBiXVa6RSbk0]{Vistani Execrator 11-Isolating Curse}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.G9Fh7Sb2A6txEDiu]{Vistani Execrator 12-Fumbling Curse}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.EAoFqUO7YndZTthy]{Vistani Execrator 20-Deadly Repercussions}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 380, page(s) 87. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock </p><p>You are a figure of rumor and local folklore. You learned your craft from the First Order, ascended quickly to the Second Order, and made your pacts to the invisible magi of the Third Order. In return for your devotion, they have given you the power to beguile and warp minds. </p><p>Your ways are mysterious and frightening to other creatures. When you use your spells, and even when you speak, people sit and listen, enraptured by the hypnotic sound of your words and mesmerized by your eyes. Few ever realize what they risk upon meeting your ensnaring gaze or listing to your enthralling voice. Those who do realize your true power consider themselves lucky to have survived the experience. </p><p><b>ENTRANCING MYSTIC PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Maddening Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one creature within 5 squares of you takes ongoing 5 psychic damage (save ends). </p><p><b>Mystic Rapture (11th level)</b></p><p>Each enemy that enters a space within 3 squares of you or that starts its turn there takes a -5 penalty to saving throws against charm effects and a -2 penalty to all other saving throws. </p><p><b>Mystery Given Form (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll of each charm power you use. If you use an encounter attack power that has the charm keyword and miss all targets with the attack, you don't expend the use of that power. </p><p><b>ENTRANCING MYSTIC POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.YCDhf9brNE3mGaoF]{Entrancing Mystic 11-Hekiah's Trance}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RVH23mjoU7lhGesd]{Entrancing Mystic 12-Shroud of Adeptus}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.aYw583G4tOK21omW]{Entrancing Mystic 20-Ultimatum of the Third Order}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 89. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Storm feat </p><p>You're more at home in the skies aboard a House Lyrandar airship than you are on the ground. Through the power of your dragon mark, you exert control over wind and weather. You're naturally held aloft by breezes, but the wind isn't just a constant companion, it's also a weapon in your arsenal. With the aid of your dragon mark, you can cause sudden bursts of wind that send your enemies flying. With enough power, you can even summon a tornado to tear through your enemy's ranks. Those who trifle with you feel the fury of the storm. </p><p><b>LYRANDAR WIND-RIDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Storm Adept (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and a bonus equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) to damage from lightning or thunder attack powers. </p><p><b>Wind-Rider Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a fly speed equal to your speed (and can hover) until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Feather's Touch (16th level)</b></p><p>Once per encounter, you can use the wizard utility power feather fall. </p><p><b>LYRANDAR WIND-RIDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.pAXdDeB1O9LTGzCv]{Lyrandar Wind-Rider 11-Wind Burst}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Bdei8TKSm57VAXyP]{Lyrandar Wind-Rider 12-Zephyr Wings}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.pcGd8U4jyliRoVfg]{Lyrandar Wind-Rider 20-Unruly Cyclone}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 72. </p>",

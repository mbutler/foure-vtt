			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock class, fey pact </p><p>Your constant visits to the Feywild and your communion with the fey entity that holds your pact have touched you to your very soul and driven you slightly mad. But within this madness, you have found the power to rise to the next level of your existence. The secrets of the Feywild might be maddening, but they provide you with new opportunities to achieve your goals and defeat your enemies. You relish the madness and can control it, but those you unleash it upon can do nothing but crumble in the wake of the unparalleled majesty of the Feywild. </p><p><b>FEYTOUCHED PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Feytouched Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you also gain a +4 bonus to attack rolls until the start of your next turn. </p><p><b>Slashing Wake (11th level)</b></p><p>Once per turn, when you leave a square by teleporting, enemies adjacent to that square take damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. </p><p><b>Patron's Favor (16th level)</b></p><p>Use Patron's Favor in place of your Misty Step when an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer.

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard class </p><p>You have learned to combine blood with arcane formulas to cast more powerful spells-your own blood. Your blood is your life, but it is also your source of power. Few wizards step upon this path to arcane mastery, because it is a path steeped in pain and soaked in blood. But you have embraced the way of blood and magic, and you have become more powerful because of it. </p><p><b>BLOOD MAGE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blood Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, each target hit by the attack takes ongoing 10 damage (save ends). </p><p><b>Bolstering Blood (11th level)</b></p><p>You learn to turn your own pain into additional pain for your enemies. When you use a wizard encounter attack power, a wizard daily attack power, or a blood mage attack power that deals damage, you can, once per turn as a free action just prior to using the power, deal either a minor wound or a severe wound to yourself. </p><p>A minor wound deals 1d10 damage to you. </p><p>A severe wound deals 2d10 damage to you. </p><p>You then gain a bonus to the power's damage rolls. The bonus equals the damage you dealt to yourself. </p><p><b>Burning Blood (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use your second wind, each enemy within 10 squares of you takes ongoing 10 fire damage (save ends), but only if that enemy is subject to an effect that a save can end. </p><p><b>BLOOD MAGE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.5Q3dZm4Lz8uO0leE]{Blood Mage 11-Blood Pulse}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ERtXpOrJ7KZl1fWq]{Blood Mage 12-Soul Burn}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.nZT8xH5pzVCRXAJi]{Blood Mage 20-Destructive Salutation}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 169, Class Compendium. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>All your life you have known you were destined for greatness, as did the ancestor spirits of your tribe's great warriors. You owe your prowess in combat to the heroes whose blood flows in your veins. When you recover your strength in combat, these guardian spirits flash into sight for a moment, defending you from your enemies so that you can fight on. </p><p>The ancestral spirits that watch over you might represent any of the heroic classes of your people. The barbarian's strength drives the fury of your attacks, just as the shaman's wisdom inspires your tactics. However, in your determination to defend your allies and the world around you, you remain a warden through and through. </p><p><b>TRIBAL CHAMPION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Allied Champions (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use your second wind as a standard action, each enemy marked by you takes psychic damage equal to one-half your level + your Strength modifier. </p><p>When you use your second wind as a minor action, one enemy marked by you takes psychic damage equal to your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Tribal Champion Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can choose a guardian form granted by any of your daily powers. Until the end of your next turn, you assume that form and gain all its effects, but you cannot use the form's attack. This use of the form does not expend the use of the power that grants it, and you can assume a form granted by a power you have already used today. </p><p><b>Ferocious Defender (16th level)</b></p><p>When an ally adjacent to you is bloodied for the first time in an encounter, you gain a +1 power bonus to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>TRIBAL CHAMPION POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.N75j3pP6TCQwtd0h]{Tribal Champion 11-Fell the Mighty}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3IgA4H2fJ8kaRtqd]{Tribal Champion 12-Pure Power}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.VHwpotm9v8fSKZ3b]{Tribal Champion 20-Form of the Tribal Champion}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 113. </p>",

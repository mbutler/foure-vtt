			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Eladrin or elf, must worship Corellon </p><p>Lolth's return and a resumption of the disastrous war that nearly shattered the elven peoples cast a terrible shadow across Corellon's priesthood. Anticipating this event, the elders formed the Azure Guard who would one day serve as the principle leaders in repelling Lolth's demonic forces. The warriors combine prayers to Corellon with secret arcane spells to achieve the edge they need to overcome their enemies. Azure Guard members do not advertise their special status lest they invite assassins to strike at them. One cannot join the Azure Guard without invitation, and even those called to serve in its esteemed ranks may find themselves unequal to the demands the training makes. </p><p><b>AZURE GUARD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Enemy of the Darkness (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks, Perception checks, and saving throws against poison. </p><p><b>Excellence in Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point to make an attack, you can reroll one attack roll of that attack that misses.

Even adversaries that think they've outsmarted you find themselves lured into traps that give you the advantage. </p><p><b>MEDANI TRUESEER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blindless Sight (11th level)</b></p><p>You cannot be blinded, and you gain a +2 bonus to Perception checks and initiative checks. </p><p><b>Trueseer Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, any enemy you can see grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Medani Targeting (16th level)</b></p><p>Your attacks ignore cover and concealment, but not superior cover and total concealment, against a target you have combat advantage against. </p><p><b>MEDANI TRUESEER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.C0rAmH25RdgDBNEw]{Medani Trueseer 11-Medani True Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SEzaBRVc1gKIO7Ar]{Medani Trueseer 12-Medani Foretelling}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.5UIZCXv7WxKT2rEl]{Medani Trueseer 20-Disruptive Premonition}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 73. </p>",

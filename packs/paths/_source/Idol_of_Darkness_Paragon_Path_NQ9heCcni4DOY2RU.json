			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Paladin or cleric, evil alignment </p><p>Having embraced the dark side of divine magic, you are now ready to delve deeper into the forbidden, to fully embrace the power offered by the dark forces of the cosmos. Only those who have committed evil are invited to study these black arts. Through the filthy deeds you have done and the wickedness in your heart, you have proven yourself worthy. </p><p>Dabbling in occult mysteries carries a heavy price in body, mind, and soul. To harness the magic these entities offer, you must carve your f lesh with blasphemies. To understand the rites, you must push your mind to madness's brink. To prepare your soul, you must indulge in every evil, wallowing in the horror of it all. </p><p>Where paladins fight for honor, good, and order, idols of darkness are treacherous, wicked, and capricious in their dealings. They kill for pleasure. They maim to learn from their victim's suffering. They never hesitate to feed their ambition and to grow their temporal power-they know that beyond the mortal coil lies only annihilation. </p><p><b>IDOL OF DARKNESS PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Unwholesome Resilience (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain resist 10 necrotic and resist 10 poison. You also gain immunity to diseases of your level or lower. </p><p><b>Vile Darkness Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain partial concealment against enemies while they are adjacent to you and a +4 power bonus to damage rolls. If you are bloodied, the concealment is total concealment. Either way, these benefits last until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Death-Driven (16th level)</b></p><p>Once per round, when a creature within 5 squares of you drops below 1 hit point, you can take a free action to shift up to a number of squares equal to your Charisma modifier. </p><p><b>IDOL OF DARKNESS POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.4rTVyH27jCY5K6ue]{Idol of Darkness 11-Font of Despair}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.RrKf2XjxV16chEuI]{Idol of Darkness 12-Unholy Aura}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.1nAMKClODYvGmSfe]{Idol of Darkness 20-Dark Burden}</p><p>Published in The Book of Vile Darkness, page(s) 1-26. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Monk </p><p>Fat Aloisus teaches any he meets who have the skill and the will to learn. In like manner, those he teaches are instructed to pass on his training to those whom they meet. Whether they wander for love of maps and food, a search for truth, a lust for treasure or adventure, or a noble quest, their wandering is aided by the lessons they learn from other travelers. </p><p>As a student of the Falling Needle practice and an itinerant, your techniques aid you-typically when others decide to attack you. You move swiftly on the road and in the heat of combat. You might be struck, but you do not remain in place for a second blow. </p><p><b>FALLING NEEDLE ITINERANT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Falling Needle Training (11th level)</b></p><p>When you use a monk power or monk paragon path power to shift, you shift 1 additional square. </p><p><b>Itinerant Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When an attack hits you, you can spend an action point as an immediate interrupt to gain a +4 bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Path of the Itinerant Monk (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Endurance checks.

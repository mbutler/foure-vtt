			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>Although many wardens acknowledge the All-Spirit in name, you welcome the All-Spirit into the very core of your being, transforming yourself into the strong right hand of the All-Spirit and seeking to bring the truth of the All-Spirit to bear in everything you do. </p><p>Becoming a scion of the All-Spirit is a transformative experience that shapes you in myriad ways. You shrug off the seemingly inconsequential minutiae of your mortal existence in favor of embracing the greater spirit that subsumes all creation. Although you still exist in corporeal form, you develop a spiritual communion with the All-Spirit that reshapes your essence and combines your soul with the greatest primal spirit. You are a pure representative of the All-Spirit, seeking to protect the natural world by channeling the power you have been granted by the All-Spirit. </p><p><b>SCION OF THE ALL-SPIRIT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>All-Spirit Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you become insubstantial and gain phasing until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>All-Spirit Strike (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you score a critical hit, your damage ignores all the target's resistances, including insubstantial. </p><p><b>Share the All-Spirit (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend a healing surge, one ally within 5 squares of you makes a saving throw with a bonus equal to your Constitution modifier. </p><p><b>SCION OF THE ALL-SPIRIT POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.iyDovcKO0H86LMfm]{Scion of the All-Spirit 11-Voice of the All-Spirit}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.2Kz5goShc0tyA4fQ]{Scion of the All-Spirit 12-All-Spirit Step}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.tT1Ud406NgDYvP2u]{Scion of the All-Spirit 20-Form of the All-Spirit}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 43. </p>",

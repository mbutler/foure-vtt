			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warden </p><p>Like the trees of the forest, you draw strength from the loamy earth, from the water that spills from the sky and flows across the land, and from the radiance of the sun. You embrace the essence of the tree, becoming the forest's protector, its champion against those that would despoil it. When you use your primal powers, shoots of new growth emerge from the ground, flowers bloom, and trees straighten with renewed vigor. </p><p>You favor guardian form powers that let you take on treelike forms (such as form of the willow sentinel, form of the oak sentinel, and form of the rowan sentinel), but even when you take on other aspects, the earth responds with growth. As the culmination of this path, you can take on a form like that of a treant, smashing foes and objects alike with a weapon held in your branchlike fists. </p><p><b>VERDANT LORD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Reaching Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action while you are in a guardian form, your melee reach increases by 1 until the end of your turn. </p><p><b>Writhing Roots (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are in a guardian form, enemies treat each square adjacent to you as difficult terrain, and each ally adjacent to you gains a +1 bonus to AC. </p><p><b>Iron Boughs (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with a melee attack and the enemy is marked by you, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. </p><p><b>VERDANT LORD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9Cd6sf0SMjgmeXBp]{Verdant Lord 11-Falling Tree Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.UGlEmwQpsCdeDfn7]{Verdant Lord 12-Awaken the Forest}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.7EuqiVOH648Nes5l]{Verdant Lord 20-Form of the Verdant Lord}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 169. </p>",

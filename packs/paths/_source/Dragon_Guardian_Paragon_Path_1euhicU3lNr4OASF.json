			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer, Dragon Magic class feature </p><p>Dragons are your legacy. You embody one of the manifestations of draconic might. The sheer physical power of dragons inspires you. Your foes glimpse these truths when you demonstrate your powers. </p><p>You have studied the movements and strategies of dragons as they fight, both when you heard or read about dragons in epic stories and on a few occasions when you were menaced by one. You are drawn to dragons' lairs or other places where dragons congregate, eager to learn more about the mighty beasts that are your personal idols. </p><p><b>DRAGON GUARDIAN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Dragon Breath Action (Dragon Guardian) (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also use your dragon breath power as a free action, even if you have already expended it in this encounter. </p><p><b>Guardian's Resistance (11th level)</b></p><p>Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Add that damage type to the resistance granted by your Dragon Soul. You can't choose a damage type that your Dragon Soul already grants you resistance to. </p><p><b>Indomitable Breath (16th level)</b></p><p>When you make an attack roll with a close blast power, you ignore any resistance and immunity that creatures have to the attack. </p><p><b>DRAGON GUARDIAN POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.R8KFjHfkwc7Gap0O]{Dragon Guardian 11-Guardian's Breath}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.8wNdRUcIy3FEGeBX]{Dragon Guardian 12-Shield of Dragon Might}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Qi306PMyxrUR2weS]{Dragon Guardian 20-Lasting Breath}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 44. </p>",

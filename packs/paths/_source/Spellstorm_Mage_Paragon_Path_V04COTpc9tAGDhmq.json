			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Wizard class </p><p>To you, the arcane energy flowing through the world is like a raging storm that only you can see. Moreover, you can shape and control this arcane storm to accomplish amazing things. The storm consists of individual spells, like each drop of rain in the maelstrom, and you can pluck these spells free and direct them as you will. You are a spellstorm mage, and you stand among the arcane torrent and use it to enhance the power that you wield. </p><p>(1/25/2012) </p><p>Updated in Class Compendium. </p><p><b>SPELLSTORM MAGE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Extra Damage Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a power bonus to the damage rolls of your standard action attacks this turn. The bonus equals one-half your level. </p><p><b>Storm Spell (11th level)</b></p><p>Once per day, you can reach into the spellstorm and extract an arcane power that you have already used so that you can use it again. Make a Wisdom check. The result indicates the kind of arcane power that you can extract. You can choose to extract an arcane power associated with a lower result than the result you rolled. </p><p>1-10: Arcane encounter utility power. </p><p>11-15: Arcane encounter attack power. </p><p>16-20: Arcane daily utility power. </p><p>21 or Higher: Arcane daily attack power. </p><p><b>Storm Fury (16th level)</b></p><p>When you first become bloodied in an encounter, you unleash a burst of arcane energy that deals 5 + your Wisdom modifier lightning damage to each enemy within 10 squares of you. </p><p><b>SPELLSTORM MAGE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.59csUyFwIgQpHxj8]{Spellstorm Mage 11-Storm Cage}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.nuGFBC5Acl7Y8Zox]{Spellstorm Mage 12-Sudden Storm}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.1PaY6J9NmBXWhgbF]{Spellstorm Mage 20-Maelstrom of Chaos}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 170, Class Compendium. </p>",

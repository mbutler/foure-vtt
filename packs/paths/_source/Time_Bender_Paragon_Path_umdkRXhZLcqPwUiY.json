			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Psion </p><p>Psions, especially those who prefer telekinetic powers to telepathic ones, instinctively recognize how the fabric of space is just one side of the swath; the other side is time. Objects, creatures, and worlds travel through both, though time is a direction that has only a single route-forward-while space allows movement any which way. </p><p>Or so it seems to most. But for those who are able to literally grasp the fabric of space to stretch, compact, and shape it, time is more malleable, within limits. Understanding this fact opens up new possibilities. </p><p>You recognize time's pliability. You already have an arsenal of mental tools capable of gripping the seams in the material of space. You have discovered that you can also use your understanding of the nature of time as a springboard to greater power. As your knowledge of time's intricacies has grown, so has your ability to affect time. You believe you'll soon be wielding time like a sword to cut down your foes before they even understand they're in danger. </p><p><b>TIME BENDER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Loan from the Past (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you roll initiative, roll an additional d20. Once during that encounter, you can replace an attack roll, a skill check, an ability check, or a saving throw with that roll. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Time-Lapse (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack with a psionic power, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll and can teleport 6 squares as a free action after the attack. </p><p><b>Borrow from the Future (16th level)</b></p><p>You can take an extra move action during your turn, but if you do so, you lose your move action on your next turn. You can't use this feature on consecutive rounds. </p><p><b>TIME BENDER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.84LcXInFDZhNG6PA]{Time Bender 11-Bonds of Time}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.VyCqUsOhISZpGzTa]{Time Bender 12-Time Strider}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.tHQrkY0cBn3EoxO4]{Time Bender 20-Lost in Time}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 96. </p>",

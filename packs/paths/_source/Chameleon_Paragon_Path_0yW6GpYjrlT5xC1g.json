			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Changeling </p><p>As a changeling, you alter appearances and identities to suit your purpose. As a chameleon, you take versatility to a new level. You absorb the mannerisms and actions of those around you through careful observation. You not only change your appearance, you alter your powers and are able to perform an astonishing range of maneuvers. The more time you spend with a person, the more accurately you can mimic his or her actions and abilities. </p><p><b>CHAMELEON PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Coordinated Action (11th level)</b></p><p>If you have not already spent an action point in the encounter, when an ally spends an action point to take an extra action, you can spend an action point as an immediate reaction. Your action must be taken after your ally has resolved the action from his or her action point. </p><p><b>Shifting Skill (11th level)</b></p><p>During an extended rest, choose one skill in which an ally is trained. At the end of the extended rest, you gain training in that skill until the end of your next extended rest. The ally whose skill you choose must be present during the entire extended rest. </p><p><b>Power Focus (16th level)</b></p><p>During a short rest, choose one of your allies' class or paragon path encounter attack powers of 11th level or lower. At the end of the short rest, you can swap the encounter attack power you gained with imitating strike for the chosen attack power. The ally whose power you gain must be present during the entire short rest. </p><p><b>CHAMELEON POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.vR9luLGdO8zPSA2Q]{Chameleon 11-Imitating Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.m5uySbrK3lPdhEOA]{Chameleon 12-Perfect Mimicry}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.7OgFNdPnQGvly5k6]{Chameleon 20-Deadly Duplication}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 60. </p>",

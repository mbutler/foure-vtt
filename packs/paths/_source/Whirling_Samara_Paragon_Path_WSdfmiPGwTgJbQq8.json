			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid, Primal Swarm class feature </p><p>As a druid who assumes swarm shapes, you have already mastered complex magic that maintains your identity even while you are dispersed in the form of many insects. Your new path focuses on gaining greater control of the individuals that compose your swarm forms. Most druids work with one swarm shape at a time, but you mix many different types of seeds, leaves, insects, and other natural things into a supremely flexible form, which adapts to any challenge. </p><p>Many of your powers take advantage of the whirling wings of the seeds called samaras or the buzzing wings of insects. You can take f light as smoothly as you shift into beast form, then send pieces of yourself whirling among your allies to protect them from harm. </p><p><b>WHIRLING SAMARA PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Parting Swarm (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are in beast form, you are immune to being pulled, pushed, and slid by melee attacks and ranged attacks. </p><p><b>Shed Bulk for Speed (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can reroll two different attack rolls before the end of your next turn. When you make one of these rerolls, you take 1d10 + one-half your level damage and use either result. </p><p><b>Spinning Wings (16th level)</b></p><p>When you change from humanoid form to your beast form on your turn, you gain a fly speed equal to your speed until the end of your turn. </p><p><b>WHIRLING SAMARA POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.FEi4gQ83qrARZC6L]{Whirling Samara 11-Protective Spiral}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.jEmg7QXTnPN3Ol9z]{Whirling Samara 12-Dark Wings}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.142SPaeDfrNw6gQR]{Whirling Samara 20-Great Winged Samara}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 59. </p>",

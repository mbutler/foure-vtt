			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Shadow feat </p><p>The entertainers and artisans of House Phiarlan employ a variety of media and techniques to express their art and distract their foes. Members of the house who show a predisposition for illusion are often trained as phantasmists. As a phantasmist, you excel in evasion and deception. Your training has taught you how to bring your enemies' nightmares to life. You can cloak yourself in shadows or trick foes with illusory forms. When you perfect your art, you even gain the power to make an illusion into a deadly reality. </p><p><b>PHIARLAN PHANTASMIST PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Mind Fire (11th level)</b></p><p>Any enemy affected by one of your charm, fear, illusion, or psychic powers takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against that power's effect. </p><p><b>Phantasmist Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you or one ally within 3 squares of you becomes invisible until the start of your next turn. </p><p><b>Phase-Mist Shroud (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use an illusion power, you gain concealment and a +1 bonus to attacks rolls with charm, fear, illusion, or psychic powers until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>PHIARLAN PHANTASMIST POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.2rwJCHgtQqsKSb97]{Phiarlan Phantasmist 11-Disturbing Visions}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.2iXpPtNLzQfcGnwV]{Phiarlan Phantasmist 12-Taunting Decoy}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Zd1CFUtSApVR4reE]{Phiarlan Phantasmist 20-Phantasmist Stalker}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 75. </p>",

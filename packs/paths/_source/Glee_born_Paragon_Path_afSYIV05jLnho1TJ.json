			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dragonborn, any arcane class </p><p>Dragonborn can be a harsh and taciturn race. When a dragonborn becomes known for excessive jesting or practical jokes, he or she is shunned and called glee-born or \"touched by copper.\" Rather than accept scorn, glee-born embrace their fun-loving nature and welcome the title with pride, even if they are forced into exile away from dragonborn lands. Luckily, many human kings welcome glee-born into their courts as jesters or courtesans. </p><p>Glee-born are quick to laugh, but they can be dangerous in battle. A sly word or cutting insult can easily distract a foe, and glee-born are known to have arcane talents that they use liberally in combat. </p><p>Only true copper dragons could match the sly wit of a glee-born, and many scholars posit that the gleeborn must have coppers in their lineage. Indeed, the scales of older glee-born have been known to develop an orange hue and even a green verdigris tinge late in life. If they live long enough, that is. </p><p><b>GLEE-BORN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Glib Tongue (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +3 bonus to Bluff checks and Diplomacy checks. </p><p><b>Insulting Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you miss a target that grants combat advantage to you, you can spend an action point to reroll that attack roll with a +2 bonus. You must use the result of the second roll. </p><p><b>Captive Audience (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit a creature with an arcane attack, each enemy adjacent to the target grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>GLEE-BORN POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eC9MjXf7lkozEQmI]{Glee-born 11-Flip and Blast}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.zN0XpifWRZSaAPbQ]{Glee-born 12-Revealing Feint}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.yL9wibjU70cRzPko]{Glee-born 20-Set a Riddle}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 9. </p>",

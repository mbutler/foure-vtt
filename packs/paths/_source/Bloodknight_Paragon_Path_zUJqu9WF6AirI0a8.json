			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Defender role, Vampiric Heritage feat </p><p>Your vampire heritage has served only to make you a stronger warrior. It could be that you grew up in a vampire clan, and were shaped and honed into a perfect weapon for their aims. Several like you have such a history. Or maybe you've listened to your blood's whispers, gaining supernatural talents as a reward for your efforts. The blood of your enemies cries out to your own. You sense those you have marked for death like a wolf smell's fear in the hunted. Your adversaries are your prey, to be driven where you wish and ultimately struck down to supplement your strength. </p><p><b>BLOODKNIGHT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Blood-Calling Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an extra attack, you also mark all enemies within close burst 2 until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Taste for Blood (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you reduce a bloodied enemy you have marked to 0 hit points, you recharge your blood drain power and can use it again during this encounter. </p><p><b>Marked Blood (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you grab a target you have marked, you can use your blood drain power on that target immediately as a free action. </p><p><b>BLOODKNIGHT POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.xacVlOZBerzTmEJd]{Bloodknight 11-Bloodseeking Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.GrBjkwc3JQlOxEdV]{Bloodknight 12-Mistblood Form}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ZehOlqBcFsV46LMG]{Bloodknight 20-Dance of Blood}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine Annual, Dragon Magazine 371, page(s) 36. </p>",

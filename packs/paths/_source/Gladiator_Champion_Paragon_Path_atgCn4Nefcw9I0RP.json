			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Gladiator theme or fighter </p><p>The people need heroes. They need brave individuals to show them that adversity can be overcome no matter how tough the opposition. They need to witness battle to slake their thirst for blood, to vent their frustration and anger about their own lives. They need gladiators, for these bold warriors give them all they need and more. </p><p>You are the champion the people demand. You might have come from humble roots, having grown up as a slave or a criminal, or you could be a professional who chose this dangerous life for glory and coin. Regardless, something about you and your courage resonates with the people, and you become more than just another warrior fighting for your life in the pit. You are their hero. </p><p><b>GLADIATOR CHAMPION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Halo of Destruction (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you bloody an enemy with an attack, each enemy adjacent to you (other than the one you bloodied) takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Undaunted Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack while you are bloodied, you roll two dice for one attack roll during that attack and use either result. </p><p><b>Whirlwind of Destruction (16th level)</b></p><p>Enemies adjacent to you cannot shift to a square that is not adjacent to you. </p><p><b>GLADIATOR CHAMPION POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.wqHrepBKG5Y84yhf]{Gladiator Champion 11-Opening Ploy}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Ujw45lGKWbALHaqJ]{Gladiator Champion 12-Fail to Disappoint}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.INcrBy5g4OHfMXD2]{Gladiator Champion 20-Finishing Strike}</p><p>Published in Dark Sun Campaign Setting, page(s) 52. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Battlemind </p><p>Hidden pathways and secret portals riddle the world and the planes. You possess the keen eye and open mind that let you pick out these shortcuts and exploit them. Your understanding of planar mechanics might be instinctive, originating in an unusual knack for sensing and locating such anomalies. It might be the result of extensive training, in which you learned from a master unbound nomad how to circumvent the bounds of reality. However you came by your knowledge, you can travel unseen byways with ease. </p><p>As an unbound nomad, you are rarely in one place for long. You use your talent to slip through the cracks in the world around you, then reappear wherever you want. You can dodge through new gateways to escape a persistent enemy, or force your foes into the unseen spaces between the planes. Your unpredictability leaves your enemies confused, chasing after phantoms as you take charge of the battlefield around them. </p><p><b>UNBOUND NOMAD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Banishing Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, you teleport one target hit by the attack 5 squares. </p><p><b>Nomad's Prerogative (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever an enemy pushes you, you can ignore the push and teleport 3 squares. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Nomad's Journey (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you use your blurred step power, you can teleport a number of squares equal to your Dexterity modifier instead of shifting. You must teleport to a square adjacent to the enemy that triggered that power. </p><p><b>UNBOUND NOMAD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.LqxVeTORNgap4DJm]{Unbound Nomad 11-Cunning Abduction}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.SrkIPDHTqMBYbgNU]{Unbound Nomad 12-One Hundred Doors}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.vkfAaYJEUsOR4uQr]{Unbound Nomad 20-Unstable Nexus}</p><p>Published in Psionic Power, page(s) 53. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Mark of Making feat </p><p>The mastermakers of House Cannith are among the most powerful spellcasters of the thirteen dragonmarked houses. The house counts numerous artificers and wizards among its ranks. As a Cannith mastermaker, you are a part of the house's august magical tradition. You are capable of coaxing hidden power out of your magic items, and you can use that power in unusual ways. The untold days spent handling residuum and other components have left their mark, though. Most mastermakers have hands that bear permanent silver streaks. </p><p><b>CANNITH MASTERMAKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Item Affinity (11th level)</b></p><p>After an extended rest, you can use three magic item daily powers per day. At 21st level, you can use five magic item daily powers per day. </p><p><b>Mastermaker Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, one of your expended magic item daily powers recharges. </p><p><b>Arcane Rechanneling (16th level)</b></p><p>Once per encounter as a free action during your turn, you can expend one of your uses of a magic item daily power to regain the use of an arcane encounter attack power. </p><p><b>CANNITH MASTERMAKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.tCsojLxSVgDkP1RI]{Cannith Mastermaker 11-Power Siphon}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ySIqOWFo7PEA8b5X]{Cannith Mastermaker 12-Item Resurgence}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.milqIoujwdQka34W]{Cannith Mastermaker 20-Lightning Infusion}</p><p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 67. </p>",

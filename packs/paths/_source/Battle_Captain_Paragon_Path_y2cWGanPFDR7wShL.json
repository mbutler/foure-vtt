As a leader who fights as well as he leads, you have earned the loyalty and respect of your allies, and together you have been forged into a cohesive combat team. </p><p><b>BATTLE CAPTAIN PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Battle Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your allies gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls until the start of your next turn. To gain this bonus an ally has to see and hear you when you spend the action point. </p><p><b>Cry Havoc (11th level)</b></p><p>On the first round of combat (or both the first round and the surprise round if your allies act during the surprise round), any ally who starts his or her turn within 10 squares of you gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls. </p><p><b>Battle Inspiration (16th level)</b></p><p>When you heal an ally with your inspiring word, the ally gains a +1 power bonus to attack rolls and speed until the end of your next turn.

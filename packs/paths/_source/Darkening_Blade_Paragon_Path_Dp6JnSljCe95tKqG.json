			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dusk Elf Stealth feat </p><p>Gloaming guardians protect their communities from intruders and occasional trespassers, but even the barrier they create cannot catch all who prowl their lands. Should their communities come under attack, the dusk elves flee, vowing vengeance on those who wrong them. The darkening blades embody the vengeance they swear and to them the dusk elves turn to destroy their enemies. </p><p>As a darkening blade, you have mastered a secret fighting style perfected through generations spent in exile. Shadows gather around you so that when you move, you blend into them, making it hard for your enemies to track your movements and attack you. When you strike, you do so with speed and accuracy, darting in, then melding into the gloom. </p><p><b>DARKENING BLADE PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Gloaming Action (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you spend an action point to make an extra attack, you can shift your speed into a space adjacent to your target before the attack. </p><p><b>Night Eyes (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you have total concealment, you also have darkvision. </p><p><b>Flitting Shadows (16th level)</b></p><p>When you charge or run, you are treated as being insubstantial for the purposes of taking damage from opportunity attacks. </p><p><b>DARKENING BLADE POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.P7HMwu9Ze156p03U]{Darkening Blade 11-Vanishing Cut}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.4znid6AFjOHU3RKS]{Darkening Blade 12-Gloaming Shroud}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.1vb8zmjqTVFcxfPa]{Darkening Blade 20-Blinding Assailant}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 382, page(s) 70. </p>",

They must use the lower of the two rolls. </p><p><b>Doomsayer's Oath (16th level)</b></p><p>When you are bloodied, you gain a +2 power bonus to attack rolls when you use a power that has the fear keyword. </p><p><b>DOOMSAYER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.aU51MfnwGRPpTFZJ]{Doomsayer 11-Fates Entwined}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dto9SOQqm4W1CIbs]{Doomsayer 12-Accursed Shroud}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.9gaQ6rLhxF07SqUR]{Doomsayer 20-Long Fall into Darkness}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 140, Class Compendium. </p>",

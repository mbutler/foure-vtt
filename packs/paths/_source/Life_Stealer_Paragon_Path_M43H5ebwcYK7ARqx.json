			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock class, infernal pact </p><p>Your pact with infernal powers has given you the ability to steal and utilize the life energy of your enemies. This life energy provides you with a new avenue to power, and you hunger for it as a vampire craves blood. </p><p><b>LIFE-STEALER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Collect Life Spark (11th level)</b></p><p>When a creature under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you take a portion of its life energy by collecting a life spark. As a minor action, you can expend this life spark to gain a benefit based on the creature's origin. At the end of the encounter, any life sparks you have not expended fade away. </p><p>Aberrant: You gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Immortal: You gain resist 5 to all damage until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Elemental: You deal an extra 5 damage to the next target you hit with an attack on your current turn. </p><p>Fey: A successful attack you make on your current turn also causes your target to become dazed until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Natural: Regain hit points equal to one-half your level. </p><p>Shadow: You become invisible until the end of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack. </p><p><b>Infernal Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, if you use your action to make an attack that hits, that hit deals ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends). </p><p><b>Sustain Life Spark (16th level)</b></p><p>If you have more life sparks at the end of an encounter than you do healing surges, you regain hit points as if you had spent a healing surge </p><p><b>LIFE-STEALER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.rpmjD582hOeUGfa4]{Life-Stealer 11-Soul Scorch}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.XTGbs6LWw2HE9ZAC]{Life-Stealer 12-Life Spark Summons}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dVFhHSOUBGavKs3q]{Life-Stealer 20-Soultheft}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 141, Class Compendium. </p>",

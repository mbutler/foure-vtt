You dream of being swept away in a conflagration whose size will grow without bound and one day break through planar walls themselves. </p><p>You've heard of the ancient ones, the primordials who forged the world in an elemental explosion. You feel a kinship to those entities, and as you gain more and more power, you begin to suspect you are actually related to them. If your suspicion is more than just conjecture, what does that bode for your future? </p><p><b>PRIMORDIAL CHANNELER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Primordial Manifestation (11th level)</b></p><p>If the type of resistance currently provided by your Wild Soul is cold, fire, lightning, or thunder, you also gain the benefit described below. </p><p>Cold: Creatures hit by your attacks are slowed until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Fire: Creatures hit by your attacks take ongoing fire damage equal to your Dexterity modifier (save ends). </p><p>Lightning: Creatures hit by your attacks take a -2 penalty to attack rolls until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Thunder: Creatures hit by your attacks are deafened (save ends). </p><p><b>Primordial Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, each enemy within 3 squares of you takes damage equal to your Dexterity modifier. The damage type matches the type of resistance currently provided by your Wild Soul. </p><p><b>Overwhelming Elements (16th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you hit a creature with an attack, that creature's resistances are reduced by 10 (minimum 0) until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>PRIMORDIAL CHANNELER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.bFGgrm2Hd8RVinqK]{Primordial Channeler 11-Primordial Rage}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.Naw3PseBFvyqlSR8]{Primordial Channeler 12-Primordial Boon}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.3zTD4KC0VWSOJne8]{Primordial Channeler 20-Primordial Rift}</p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 47. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Runepriest, any nonevil alignment </p><p>All across Kara-Tur, runepriests go from village to village teaching not only literacy, but also the lessons found in the Path of Enlightenment. Such selfless acts, in turn, bring these runepriests closer to their own enlightenment. Recognizing this truth, a few shan zi learn how to share their blessings with their comrades and allies, further pushing back the darkness so that the light of the Celestial Emperor can purge the world of ignorance and evil. The following paragon path is available to any honorable runepriest who strives to become the consummate leader, acting through his or her allies to vanquish the opposition. </p><p><b>ENLIGHTENED WORD PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Cloud Step (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you enter a new rune state, you can enter the rune state of the cloud step instead. While you are in this rune state, allies adjacent to you can shift up to 2 squares as a free action the first time they hit an enemy each turn. You can end this rune state as a minor action to fly up to a number of squares equal to your speed. </p><p><b>Shared Enlightenment Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to use a runepriest attack power, you can choose for that attack to originate from the space of an ally within 5 squares of you, instead of originating from your space. If you do so, that ally gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your Strength modifier. </p><p><b>Radiant Cloud Step (16th level)</b></p><p>During the flight granted by the rune state of the cloud step, you are insubstantial and phasing. </p><p><b>ENLIGHTENED WORD POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.QHYzh4JXvo3VLfBE]{Enlightened Word 11-Celestial Lightning}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.kg36fqC8yhZrnO7L]{Enlightened Word 12-Touch of Hope}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.obAL5fYPauTR0Wze]{Enlightened Word 20-Words of Celestial Heaven}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 404. </p>",

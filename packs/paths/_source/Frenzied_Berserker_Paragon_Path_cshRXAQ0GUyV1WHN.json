			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Barbarian </p><p>The devastation of the thunderstorm howls in your soul, wild and untamed. You thrill in the chaos of battle, your wrath unquenched and uncontrollable. Battle, for you, is not a means to an end; it is an end in itself. The thrill of combat draws you on, and wounds only drive you to greater frenzy. </p><p>Caught in the tumult of your anger, you must attack-calculated maneuvers and intricate strategies are diversions. You attack with sweeping blows that cleave through your enemies or lock single foes in deadly exchanges that can end only in the death of one or the other of you. When the furor of battle seizes you, you ignore pain and keep fighting when others would fall, an unconquerable whirlwind of destruction. </p><p><b>FRENZIED BERSERKER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Frenzied Blood (11th level)</b></p><p>If you spend an action point to make a melee attack and that attack misses, you deal half of that attack's damage on the miss. This benefit does not apply to attacks that already deal damage on a miss. </p><p><b>Warpath (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you hit with a melee attack while raging, the attack deals 2 extra damage. In addition, whenever you start your turn adjacent to one or more enemies while you are raging and are able to take actions, you must make either a melee or a close attack against one of those enemies during your turn or be stunned until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Unfeeling Rage (16th level)</b></p><p>You gain resist 5 to all damage while you are bloodied and raging. </p><p><b>FRENZIED BERSERKER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.K7CoMnLt3O5ckaIR]{Frenzied Berserker 11-Persistent Frenzy}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.YV623TvGLjBth0xH]{Frenzied Berserker 12-Deathless Frenzy}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.spbnG6H5t1RYLikS]{Frenzied Berserker 20-Final Confrontation}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 64. </p>",

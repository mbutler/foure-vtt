			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Shaman, call spirit companion power </p><p>Legend tells of a great spiritual storm that forms the center of the natural world. This great, eternal upheaval represents the power and feral nature of the primal world. Spirits of the great wind ebb and flow around spirits of rain and thunder as aspects of lightning streak and flash in an eternal, chaotic mass. The chaos inherent in the great storm is equal only to the power that lies within it. </p><p>Only a powerful shaman can take up the mantle of the stormcaller. You can bring temporary order to the great storm and bend its power to your will. You call forth lightning spirits to empower your companions. You summon primal rains and wind to batter and bewilder your foes, while sheltering your allies and allowing them to move around the battlefield effortlessly. Your close ties to the great storm grant you and your allies protection from nature's fury. </p><p><b>STORMCALLER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Charged Companion (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever an enemy makes an attack against your spirit companion, that enemy takes lightning damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

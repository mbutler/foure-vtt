			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Call spirit companion power </p><p>Your mind is the gateway through which you imprint your will upon the world. In your studies, you have searched for more powerful ways of asserting that will. By choosing the mind flayer as your totem creature, you've gained some of the illithid's natural prowess at bending the wills of lesser beings. </p><p>This connection has taught you hidden secrets of mental dominion, and you've found that they can also be applied to the shamanic practice of summoning spirit companions. In order to bind your new spirit companion to your will, you had to prove your dominance over it. Your spirit companion was cowed, to the point that it is more slave than friend. Even so, you know that if you let your guard down for a moment, the slave will try to become the master. </p><p><b>PHRENIC MASTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Enervating Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack, any enemy hit with the attack takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against any effects the attack imposes. Enemies hit by the attack grant combat advantage until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Spiteful Retaliation (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever an enemy attacks your spirit companion and causes it to disappear, that enemy is dazed until the end of its next turn. </p><p><b>Twin-Souled Projection (16th level)</b></p><p>You can choose to use your spirit companion's square as the origin square for any of your ranged or area powers. If your spirit companion is not adjacent to any enemies, using a power in this manner does not provoke opportunity attacks. </p><p><b>PHRENIC MASTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.V3bYLwh8uHIgTQe9]{Phrenic Master 11-Intellect Pummel}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.lmSG63PUiTtXq2D9]{Phrenic Master 12-Minion's Shield}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.NBdLT9iESOnfUomV]{Phrenic Master 20-Total Subjugation}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 394. </p>",

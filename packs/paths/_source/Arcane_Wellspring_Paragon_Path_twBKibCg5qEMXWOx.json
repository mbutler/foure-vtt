			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Sorcerer </p><p>Arcane power flows in all sorcerers, an innate part of them. For you, however, that power is like a geyser building up beneath the earth before it finally erupts with devastating and glorious force. Your connection to that power has always been easy, almost instinctual. It's so much a part of you that it slowly transforms you, making you into a being as much of the forces you channel as of flesh and soul. </p><p>As you walk the path of the arcane wellspring, you master a second damage type. You learn spells that channel both damage types or that surround you with swirling arcane energy. Ultimately, you gain the ability to transform yourself into arcane energy for a brief time. </p><p><b>ARCANE WELLSPRING PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Double Resistance (11th level)</b></p><p>If you have Dragon Magic, choose a second damage type for your Dragon Soul class feature. If you have Wild Magic, roll twice on the Wild Soul table after each extended rest. (If you get the same result a second time, roll again.) Whichever of these two Spell Source options you have, you gain resistance to both damage types, and your arcane powers ignore any target's resistance to both types up to the value of your resistance. </p><p><b>Split Spell Action (11th level)</b></p><p>You can spend an action point to target an additional creature when you use an arcane power that normally targets only one, instead of taking an extra action. </p><p><b>Antagonistic Transposition (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use an arcane power that is an area or a close attack, you can teleport two creatures hit by the attack, swapping their positions before resolving the attack. </p><p><b>ARCANE WELLSPRING POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.WFwZTtN4B6pP3kdY]{Arcane Wellspring 11-Twin Bolt}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.v3FpiOlGNBASKarQ]{Arcane Wellspring 12-Sorcerous Wings}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.np92RHPF0AEhVCTy]{Arcane Wellspring 20-Sorcerous Metamorphosis}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 148. </p>",

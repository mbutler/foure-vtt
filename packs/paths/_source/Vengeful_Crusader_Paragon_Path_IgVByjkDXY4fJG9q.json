Hate for all those who know nothing but evil. You channel this blazing wrath into your attacks to ensure the perpetrators pay for their crimes. Those who raise your ire can expect no mercy from you-only death. </p><p><b>VENGEFUL CRUSADER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Vengeance's Imperative (11th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy marked by you makes an attack that doesn't include you as the target, you can shift 1 square toward that enemy after the attack as a free action. </p><p><b>Vengeful Action (Vengeful Crusader) (11th level)</b></p><p>When an enemy you have combat advantage against hits an ally you can see, you can spend an action point as an immediate interrupt to make a basic attack against that enemy.

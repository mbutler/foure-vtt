			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Half-orc, swordmage, Aegis of Assault class feature </p><p>You have proven yourself to the Sharakim and are a full blademaster of the order. It has not been an easy path, but you have found a balance between your instincts and the rules of the society in which you live. You have trained in etiquette so that you are, at the least, competent in such matters, but you are not afraid to unleash your inner savage when it serves you better. In either case, your words demand that listeners pay you heed. </p><p>In battle, you are continually in motion. Each step flows another strike against a foe, and when you explode into action, all enemies around you can feel the pain. Even in the middle of your battle fury, you work to protect your allies, drawing a foe's attention to you with every blow. </p><p><b>SHARAKIM BLADEMASTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Flurry of Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a swordmage attack or a Sharakim blademaster attack, if the attack hits you can use your furious assault racial power to add extra damage to that attack, even if you have already used furious assault during this encounter. </p><p><b>Sharakim Gravitas (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain training in Diplomacy and Intimidate. The first time that you earn a success with Diplomacy or Intimidate during a skill challenge, it counts as two successes, even if the skill allows for a maximum of one success. </p><p><b>Expansive Aegis (16th level)</b></p><p>The range on your aegis of assault power increases to Close burst 5. </p><p><b>SHARAKIM BLADEMASTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.QaksPzDb0VWnGCwK]{Sharakim Blademaster 11-Blade Flows Like Water}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.fBlZqUIOvrF6i7bT]{Sharakim Blademaster 12-Ghost Lion's Step}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.oa7NSuysBfkw5RZ3]{Sharakim Blademaster 20-Enforced Peace}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 386, page(s) 62. </p>",

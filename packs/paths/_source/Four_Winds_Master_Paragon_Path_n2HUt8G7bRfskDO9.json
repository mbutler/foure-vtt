			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Monk </p><p>Devotees of the four winds strive for peace and tranquility in all that they do. They recognize, however, that violence is sometimes necessary to achieve greater harmony. Just as destructive winds can carry away anything that stands against them, a monk of the four winds is an overwhelming force. </p><p><b>FOUR WINDS MASTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Gusting Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make an attack and the attack hits, you shift your speed after resolving the attack. </p><p><b>Mystery of the Four Winds (11th level)</b></p><p>After each extended rest, choose one of the following mysteries. The benefit of that mystery lasts until you choose another mystery. </p><p>Mystery of the East Wind: You gain lightning resistance equal to one-half your level. In addition, whenever you shift, you can move 2 squares before or after the shift. </p><p>Mystery of the North Wind: You gain cold resistance equal to one-half your level and a +5 bonus to saving throws against charm effects and fear effects. </p><p>Mystery of the South Wind: You gain force resistance equal to one-half your level and a +4 bonus to initiative checks. </p><p>Mystery of the West Wind: You gain thunder resistance equal to one-half your level.

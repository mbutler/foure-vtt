			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Any arcane class </p><p>You have a diploma from one of the premier arcane academies, but that bit of paper was only a formality. What you took away from your years of education was an unshakable grounding in the arcane fundamentals and a justifiable confidence in your command over these forces. Since then, you've mastered the basics of magic and have begun to weave arcane energy like a true artist. You recognize other practitioners who have your level of education by their calm control over magic, as well as the depths of their knowledge and creativity. </p><p><b>ACADEMY MASTER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Arcane Underpinning (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Arcana checks. When you hit a target with an arcane at-will attack power, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with an arcane attack power you use against that target before the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Educated Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can also reroll the next attack roll you make that misses before the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Fundamental Mastery (16th level)</b></p><p>When you hit an enemy with an arcane at-will attack power, you deal 3 extra damage of the same type as the at-will power deals. This extra damage increases to 5 at 25th level. </p><p><b>ACADEMY MASTER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.eOSnla6vFUVgCbd4]{Academy Master 11-Learned Boost}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.xSjWA6m5kKiqNnRU]{Academy Master 12-Refined Recall}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.NRfBWuhvQAJOKs95]{Academy Master 20-Master's Surge}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 374, page(s) 22. </p>",

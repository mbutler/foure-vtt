			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Fighter, Battlerager Vigor class feature </p><p>You were a terrible student. Wild and unpredictable, no lesson stuck with you. No matter how hard you tried, you'd revert back to your old reckless ways. Your problem might have come from a life among savage and warlike people, or you could just havea nasty temper. In either case, your time at the war college was brief when it was clear the instructors had nothing to teach you. In your adventures since, you have learned to channel your wrath into your attacks. When you look back on the stodgy lessons and unbearable drills, you laugh because you have learned a better way to kill. </p><p><b>WRATHBEARER PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Mounting Rage (11th level)</b></p><p>When you miss with an invigorating attack power, you gain a +2 bonus to your next attack roll. </p><p><b>Savage Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and add 1[W] extra damage to damage rolls with weapon attacks until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Endless Endurance (16th level)</b></p><p>You increase your maximum hit points by twice your Constitution modifier. </p><p><b>WRATHBEARER POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.FczYGn9DqgKhSHOA]{Wrathbearer 11-Explosive Outburst}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.aGXToNcS3HFikV2b]{Wrathbearer 12-Mocking Target}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.zTIkwblVOiojfKSG]{Wrathbearer 20-Unequaled Might}</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 378. </p>",

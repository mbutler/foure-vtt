			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Druid, Primal Swarm class feature </p><p>When you take on the form of an insect swarm, the insects glow with supernatural light. The stories of your ancestors tell of luminescent insects in primeval times, insects that led your ancestors through swamps and forests to safety. These creatures had no kindness for the enemies of your tribe and used their hypnotic lights to lead enemies astray, drowning them in deep bogs and abandoning them in animal dens. You, too, are a protector and an ally when you take on the shape of the luminescent swarm. </p><p>You can harness primal lights to bewilder and blind your enemies. Your attacks deal psychic damage and deliver effects that make it more difficult for your enemies to attack. </p><p><b>LUMINESCENT SWARM PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Luminescent Lantern (11th level)</b></p><p>While you are in beast form, you have an aura 5. The aura is filled with bright light, and allies within the aura gain a +2 bonus to saving throws. </p><p><b>Radiant Swarm Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, your beast form attacks during this turn deal extra radiant damage equal to one-half your level. </p><p><b>Blaze of Light (16th level)</b></p><p>When you use wild shape to change from beast form to your humanoid form, choose an adjacent creature (before or after you shift as part of using wild shape). That creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>LUMINESCENT SWARM POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.LAEShIYq310T64jo]{Luminescent Swarm 11-Mystifying Lights}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.HTpXsCkwyucEVngR]{Luminescent Swarm 12-Light of Clarity}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.jsxQdC3Gbfq57AgT]{Luminescent Swarm 20-Brilliant Swarm}</p><p>Published in Primal Power, page(s) 54. </p>",

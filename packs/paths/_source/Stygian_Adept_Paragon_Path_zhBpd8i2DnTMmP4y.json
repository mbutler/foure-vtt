			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Ardent </p><p>There are shadows in the mind. Unnerving memories, old fears, and crushing disappointments all lie ready to be exploited and manipulated. Those who know these fears can turn them into weapons, amplified until they unravel the consciousness. You are familiar with these fears, and you wield them like razors. </p><p>As a stygian adept, you sense the fear and terror in your enemies, harnessing these emotions and using them to attack your foes' minds. With your powers you can create phantom terrors that only your opponent can perceive, distracting the enemy from your allies as they move into position. A foe firmly in your grasp finds itself lost in a maze of half-realized imaginings, each more terrible than the last. </p><p><b>STYGIAN ADEPT PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Fleeing Fear (11th level)</b></p><p>Whenever you hit an enemy with a fear power, you can slide the enemy 1 square. </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Unraveling Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to make a fear attack, each target hit by the attack has vulnerability to all damage until the end of your next turn. The vulnerability equals your Constitution modifier. </p><p><b>Fearsome Zone (16th level)</b></p><p>Enemies in any zone created by your psionic powers take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Enemies that are immune to fear ignore this penalty. </p><p><b>STYGIAN ADEPT POWERS</b></p><p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.HhTAVdFERp4xZMWr]{Stygian Adept 11-Stygian Strike}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.HRGavXbIsLCEepwS]{Stygian Adept 12-Haunting Shadows}</p> <p>@Compendium[dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.KNgzxr59flV6ATZS]{Stygian Adept 20-Subconscious Horror}</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 40. </p>",

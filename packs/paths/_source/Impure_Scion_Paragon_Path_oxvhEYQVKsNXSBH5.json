			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Foulborn Heritage </p><p>A foulborn's life is a difficult one, and no one knows this better than you. You have carried the Far Realm's burden within you for more years than you can count. You long ago came to terms with your corruption, adapting to the unsightly transformation you were forced to endure. In doing so, you discovered ways to make the curse work for you. Many years spent testing your capabilities revealed unexpected advantages that help you exceed your normal limitations, enabling you not only to survive but to thrive. </p><p>Reflection and understanding do not come without a price, however. The more you draw on your corrupted power, the greater its effect on you and the more unhinged your mind becomes. This state of being lends itself to strange delusions and compulsions, but the power you gain is worth it. When you fully come into your legacy, you learn to share your gift with others, causing them to undergo transformations that wrack the body and mind. </p><p><b>IMPURE SCION PATH FEATURES </b> </p><p><b>Paragon Power Points (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain 2 additional power points. </p><p><b>Terrifying Action (11th level)</b></p><p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, you mark any enemy adjacent to you until the end of your next turn. </p><p><b>Unnatural Perception (11th level)</b></p><p>You gain a +2 bonus to Insight checks, Perception checks, and initiative checks.

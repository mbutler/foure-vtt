When first handled, the artifact asks, \"Who has the strength of will to wield the last living remnant of Sartine, Handmaiden of the Raven Queen?\"</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner worships the Raven Queen</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner allows a wounded ally to perish naturally</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills an Orcus follower or a demon (max. 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"The Skull and I sing praises to the Raven Queen, whose realm is as pure as newly fallen snow.\"</i><bt/>The Skull clearly recognizes the wielder as a fit conduit for the glory of the Raven Queen.</p><p>The Skull's enhancement bonus increases to +5.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +5d6 damage</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>This weapon deals an extra 2d6 damage against demons or creatures that serve Orcus.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane, Fire, Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You call forth an aura of blackfire (aura 5) that lasts until the end of the encounter.

While it continues to teach and test, it grants its wielder additional power against the enemies of the Raven Queen.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane, Fire, Implement, Necrotic) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can hurl a ball of blackfire from the Skull (area burst 1 within 10 squares); Wisdom vs. Reflex; 3d10 + Wisdom modifier necrotic and fire damage.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You can recognize an agent of Orcus; close burst 3; Wisdom vs. Will; with a success, you know if a character has knowingly allied with Orcus or aided a known agent of Orcus within the past year.</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"This Skull whispers to me, demanding that I walk in the shadow of the Raven Queen and spread her immortal words.\"</i><bt/>The Skull cautiously explores the nature of the new wielder, determining his or her devotion to the Raven Queen, attitude about death and dying, and outlook concerning Orcus and his agents.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"The Skull whispers terrible things to me, explaining to me over and over again that only the Raven Queen can send my soul to its ultimate destiny. And reminding me that neither the Skull nor the Raven Queen is particularly happy with my performance.\"</i><bt/>The Skull is not pleased with the wielder, and will soon depart in search of a more appropriate host.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than demons or those that serve Orcus. This applies whether or not you are using or even holding the Skull.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"I have failed the Raven Queen, and even the Skull rejects me!\"</i><bt/>The Skull will not remain in the wielder's possession for much longer.</p><p>The Skull's enhancement bonus drops to +3.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +3d6 damage</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures other than demons or those that serve Orcus. This applies whether or not you are using or even holding the Skull.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"The Skull must rest for a time, regaining its strength and power until the Raven Queen again has need of its services.\"</i><bt/>The Skull knows the time has come to leave its current wielder. When the character next drops to 0 hit points, the skull explodes in a burst of black fire (burst 3; automatic hit against all enemies in burst (if satisfied or better) or against all creatures in burst (if unsatisfied or angered); 15 necrotic and 15 fire damage). The Skull reconstitutes again in the Tomb of Sartine, seeking a new champion of the Raven Queen. If the Skull is at least satisfied when it moves on, it leaves behind a magic orb +5 for the wielder to use in its place.</p>",

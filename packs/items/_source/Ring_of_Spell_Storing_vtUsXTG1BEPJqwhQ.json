			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>This intricate wooden ring stores a measure of arcane power that can be unlocked in a time of need.</i></p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Ring Slot</b><b>:</b> Uncommon</p>\n<p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property:</b></p> <p>During an extended rest, you can store one at-will or encounter arcane power in this ring for future use. You can place a power that you know into the ring as long as the power's level is no higher than the ring's level. The name of the power currently contained in the ring appears in etched Elven script on the inside of the band.</p>\n<p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power âœ¦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>Use the arcane power stored in the ring as long as the stored power's level is no higher than your level. If the stored arcane power is an encounter power, you must expend an action point to unlock it. Use the stored arcane power as normal, but replace any required implement and its enhancement bonus with this ring and a +4 enhancement bonus. Once the stored arcane power is used, another arcane power must be stored in the ring before it can be used again. If a new arcane power is stored before a previously stored one is used, the previously stored power is lost. If you've reached at least one milestone today, gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll of the stored power.</p>",

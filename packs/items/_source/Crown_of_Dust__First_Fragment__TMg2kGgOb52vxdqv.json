After the attack, the dust devil disappears.</p><h2>Goals of the Crown</h2><ul><li>Be reunited into a whole item once again.</li><li>Find and resurrect or free Ul-Athra.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Fragment</h2><p>This fragment of the Crown of Dust doesn't know where to find its other fragments or the remains of Ul-Athra. It has a hazy memory of events before the Dragon struck the Crown from the primordial's head.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting Score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Each fragment of the Crown joined to the first</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner defeats an immortal (1/day)</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner or ally attacks an elemental (1/encounter)</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner defeats enemy without Crown's aid (1/encounter)</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"Soon, Ul-Athra will be found and restored to life!\"</i><bt/>The fragment is delighted because its host has shown a strong desire to revive the ancient primordial.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>You gain resist 15 poison.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Immediate Interrupt)</b></p><p><i><i>Trigger:</i></i> An enemy within 5 squares of you fails a saving throw. <i><i>Effect:</i></i> The fragment's daily power recharges.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"We're making progress, surely?

Until the artifact's concordance improves, it grants no powers, but its properties still apply.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"You've been deceiving me all along!\"</i><bt/>The fragment, enraged, punishes its host until the character's behavior improves or the artifact decides to move on. It grants no powers or properties.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"A curse upon you until your bloodline fails!\"</i><bt/>The fragment disappears in a flash of virulent purple light, most likely while its host is engaged in combat.</p>",

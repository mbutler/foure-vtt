			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>When you unroll this intricately stitched carpet, it floats just above the ground, rippling as if blown by a powerful wind.</i></p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Wondrous Item</b><b>:</b> Rare</p>\n<p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property:</b></p> <p>A greater flying carpet carries creatures and objects at a speed of fly 6 and can hover. A character on the carpet can mentally command it to fly as a move action.</p><p>Any creature on the carpet takes a -2 penalty to AC and Reflex. The carpet is 1 square by 2 squares and can carry up to two Medium or Small creatures and their gear (up to a normal load for each creature). If additional weight is placed on it, the carpet falls to the ground.</p><p>If more than one character on the carpet attempts to mentally command it, the carpet responds to each command in turn according to the characters' initiative order.</p><p>If no rider is upon it, a greater flying carpet hovers in place 1 foot above the ground if it is unrolled, or sits on the ground if it is rolled up.</p><p>Level 30: The carpet is 2 squares by 3 squares and can carry up to six Medium or Small creatures and their gear (up to a normal load for each creature). Riders don't take the penalty to AC and Reflex.</p>",

			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>This fist-sized sphere of unfathomable blackness slowly orbits about you, radiating menace.</i></p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Wondrous Item</b><b>:</b> Rare</p>\n<p class=\"basics\"><b>Properties:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain a +1 item bonus to all defenses.</li>\n<li>You gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws.</li>\n<li>The Crown Jewel cannot be damaged by any attack. The damage that would be dealt is redirected to the attacker as an equal amount of force damage.</li>\n</ul></p>\n<p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ At-Will (Move Action)</b></p><p>You can make the Crown Jewel fly at a speed of 8.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ At-Will (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can direct the Crown Jewel to attack an enemy adjacent to it. The attack uses your Charisma modifier vs. Fortitude, with a +1 bonus to the attack roll per five levels you possess, and deals 2d10 + Charisma modifier force damage per five levels you possess. A creature that is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack is utterly destroyed, and you regain 15 hit points.</p><p>Quirks: You must use a minor action each round to maintain or to regain control over the Crown Jewel. If not so controlled, the Crown Jewel stays within 8 squares of you and orbits around your space at a fly speed of 4. Potential users can attune to the Crown Jewel by spending 24 hours with the item and succeeding on a DC 30 Arcana check. An attuned user can control the Crown Jewel. If two or more attuned users try to control the item at one time, those users make opposed Charisma checks, the winner gaining control of the item for 1 round. The leader of the Karanok family can control the Crown Jewel without attuning to it and without having to beat other attuned users in an opposed Charisma check.</p>",

When you take an extended rest, the item regains one charge.</p>\n<p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (No Action)</b></p><p><i>Trigger:</i> You reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer.</p><p><i>Effect:</i> The girdle gains a charge (maximum of four).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Minor Action)</b></p><p>Requirement: The girdle must have at least one charge.</p><p><i>Effect:</i> Expend a charge. You summon a skeletal warrior in an unoccupied space within 5 squares of you. The skeletal warrior is an ally to you but not to your allies, and it lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally, choosing from the actions in its description. You must have line of effect to the skeletal warrior to command it. You and it share knowledge but not senses. When the skeletal warrior makes a check, you make the roll using your game statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties. The skeletal warrior lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges left). Otherwise, it lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</p>",

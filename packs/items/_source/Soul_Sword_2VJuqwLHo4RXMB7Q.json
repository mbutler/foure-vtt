Toward the end of that civilization, the glass citadel and its deific armies were besieged by primordial forces. Kortaja's secret weapon was a set of seven fabled swords forged by the dwarf kings and wielded by the empire's seven greatest generals. In the last battle, six of the seven swords were shattered by the blast from a magic, primordial trumpet. The seventh weapon was lost in time. Deific servants have been searching for it for millennia.</p><h2>Goals of the Soul Sword</h2><ul><li>Destroy all undead.</li><li>Challenge deviousness wherever encountered.</li><li>Find remnants of ancient Kortaja. This activity includes but is not limited to repairing lost artifacts, searching out ancient dragons who knew of the empire, and excavating ruins.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Soul Sword</h2><p>The Soul Sword communicates telepathically with its wielder, expressing its desires calmly and respectfully. It makes clear that it will defy and counter inappropriate behavior on the part of its owner. The Sword is happy if the goals of its wielder lead toward challenging deceit, especially that caused by undead creatures, and searching for remnants of Kortaja. It is obsessive about this, but does not push hard unless its wielder is being negligent.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is a member of a divine class</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner exposes a scheme perpetrated by undead or necromancers</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner has one or more powers that have the necrotic keyword</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner lies or cheats</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"I bear the instrument of the primordials' destruction.\"</i><bt/>The Soul Sword is pleased with its wielder—for the time being.

It is happy to explain its history, without dissembling or omission.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"The Sword has a mind of its own.\"</i><bt/>The Soul Sword believes its wielder has little chance of achieving its goals. It implores the owner to consider relinquishing the artifact.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> Once per day at any time, the Sword can try to take control of your body. It makes a special attack against your Will, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are dominated until you save.

Upon advancing to a new level, the possessor gains a +2 bonus to a single ability score and +2 bonus to any of two knowledge skills. The Sword disappears, seeking the next hero to elevate.<bt/>If the Sword moves on because it is displeased, the former owner takes a permanent -1 penalty to Athletics checks, Endurance checks, and Insight checks.</p>",

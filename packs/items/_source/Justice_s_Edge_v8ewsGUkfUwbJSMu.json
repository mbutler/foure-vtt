			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>This longsword, decorated with red rubies and a platinum pommel, hums with the power of the Platinum Dragon.</i></p><p>Justice's Edge is a +5 holy avenger.<br/><b>Enhancement Bonus:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls<br/><b>Critical:</b> +5d6 radiant damage<br/><b>Special:</b> Justice's Edge can be used as a holy symbol of Bahamut. It adds its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and the extra damage its property grants (if applicable) when used in this manner. You gain no weapon proficiency bonus to attack rolls when using Justice's Edge as an implement.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>Your radiant powers deal 1d10 extra radiant damage when used through this weapon.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Utility Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p><i><i>Effect:</i></i> You and each ally within 10 squares of you gain a +5 power bonus to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will until the end of your next turn.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bahamut blessed Justice's Edge to serve as a tool for justice in the hands of his divine servants. The weapon allows a character who does not revere Bahamut to wield it for a short time if that wielder acts in a manner that furthers the sword's agenda (see below). In the hands of such a wielder, the weapon acts only as a normal +5 holy avenger.</p><h2>Goals of Justice's Edge</h2><ul><li>Promote honor, justice, and freedom.</li><li>Oppose the machinations of Tiamat, her followers, and those who oppress others to further their greed.</li><li>Root out evildoers, destroy them, and expose their plans.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying Justice's Edge</h2><p>Justice's Edge is direct with its thoughts and opinions. It communicates telepathically with its wielder, but usually does so only when it is displeased. If the wielder fails to seek justice against those who have done evil, the sword speaks up in commanding and uncompromising tones.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d6</td></tr><tr><td>Owner actively worships Bahamut</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Owner furthers a just cause (1/level)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner fails to seek justice (1/day)</td><td>–2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner performs an evil act</td><td>–4</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16–20)</h3><p>Justice's Edge feels the eternal flame of justice burning in its wielder. The blade transforms this connection between it and the wielder into holy power.<br/>The sword's enhancement bonus becomes +6, and its wielder gains the use of strip the wicked as long as Justice's Edge remains pleased.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Strip the Wicked ✦ Daily (No Action)</b></p><p><i>Trigger</i>: You use Justice's Edge to hit a target with a melee attack.</p><p><i><i>Effect:</i></i> Until the end of your next turn, the target loses all immunities and resistances.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p>Justice's Edge feels a kinship with its wielder, offering a small benefit as an encouragement for further acts of valor and bravery.<bt/>The wielder gains the use of a new property as long as Justice's Edge remains satisfied or pleased.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>You gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws while you are adjacent to an evil creature.</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p>Justice's Edge recognizes in its wielder the potential to become a bastion of virtue, bravery, and fairness. At this concordance, the blade has the properties, powers, and characteristics included in its description.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1– 4)</h3><p>Justice's Edge is disappointed in the acts of its wielder, who has performed in a manner inconsistent with the blade's dedication to fighting injustice and battling evil at all costs. The sword's enhancement bonus becomes +4, and its properties and powers fail to function.</p><h3>Angry (0 or lower)</h3><p>Justice's Edge is unforgiving in the face of mortal weakness. The moment a wielder does enough to anger the sword, by failing to strike out against evil or injustice, Justice's Edge disappears, seeking a more worthy champion. The sword of Bahamut offers no second chances or long goodbyes. It might call forth servants of Bahamut to punish a wicked former wielder.</p><h3>Moving On</h3><p>Justice's Edge might abandon its wielder not out of anger but out of respect. If the sword recognizes that its wielder has become the epitome of the ethos of the Platinum Dragon, and that its own abilities are now needed to help guide a lesser hero, then the next time the wielder gains a level, the sword and scabbard vanish in a flash of platinum-white light, appearing somewhere else in the world where a champion requires a weapon in the fight against injustice and evil.</p>",

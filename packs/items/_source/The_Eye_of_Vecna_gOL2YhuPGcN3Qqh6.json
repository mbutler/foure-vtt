			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>One of two relics left behind by Vecna before he ascended to godhood, the Eye of Vecna is a red, embalmed orb that pulses as if alive, but remains icy cold to the touch. It retains a remnant of Vecna's mortal power—a power with a singular devotion to evil.</i></p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Body Slot:</b> Head</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>You gain a +1 item bonus to Arcana, Insight, and Perception checks.</li><li>The Eye grants you darkvision.</li><li>When using an attack power granted by the Eye, you can use your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) for the attack, regardless of the normal ability score noted for the power.</li></ul><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane, Charm, Implement, Psychic) ✦ At-Will (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use eyebite (warlock 1).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane, Illusion, Implement, Psychic) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use mire the mind (warlock 7).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use eye of the warlock (warlock 16).</p><p>The Eye of Vecna doesn't do anything unless installed permanently in an empty eye socket. Removing an eye to make room for the Eye of Vecna is a gory process that deals damage equal to three times the character's healing surge value. These hit points can't be restored until after the character has taken an extended rest.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once installed, the Eye of Vecna becomes part of its possessor's body, functioning just like a normal eye (though it retains its unusual appearance).</p><h2>Goals of the Eye of Vecna</h2><ul><li>Be reunited with the Hand of Vecna.</li><li>Spread the worship of Vecna across the world.</li><li>Wrest secrets from those who keep them, then use those secrets as weapons of betrayal.</li><li>Be installed in a powerful living vessel, preferably a powerful wielder of arcane magic.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Eye of Vecna</h2><p>The Eye of Vecna communicates silently with its possessor, delivering vivid hallucinatory visions about what it wants. These visions are subtle at first, but eventually they become grisly and more explicit.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye's ability to communicate is limited when it's not installed in an eye socket. Those who handle the Eye in its unattached state receive only brief visions of power—whatever is compelling to that person. They also gain a clear idea of what they need to do to acquire the Eye's power.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><p>Until its wielder implants the Eye, the artifact has no concordance and the wielder doesn't gain any of its properties or powers.</p><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner can cast at least one arcane spell</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner attaches the Hand of Vecna</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner betrays a close friend in dire straits</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner wrests an important secret from a captive</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner or ally kills an undead creature (maximum 1/encounter)</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner spends 8 hours in the presence of a higher-level arcane spellcaster (maximum 1/day)</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"The Eye and I are one.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Vecna is pleased with its host—for now. It concentrates on advancing Vecna's designs on the world, confident that it has found an effective vehicle for its ambitions.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>The Eye's item bonus to Arcana, Insight, and Perception checks increases to +5.</li><li>You take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks.</li></ul><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane, Implement) ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You call forth an aura of clear sight (aura 10) that lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, you gain a +10 bonus to all attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks made against targets within the aura.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"The Eye...it reveals so much to me.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Vecna is satisfied enough with its host, but it's still looking for a better one. It's content to serve its host, but it occasionally sends a frightening vision to remind the possessor who's really in charge.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>The Eye's item bonus to Arcana, Insight, and Perception checks increases to +2.</li><li>You take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy checks.</li></ul><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Arcane, Implement, Necrotic) ✦ Encounter (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can fire a beam of necrotic energy from the Eye. The attack is made with your highest mental ability score vs. Fortitude. A hit deals 3d6 + 5 necrotic damage and ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends).</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"I can feel the Eye's power.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first implanted in a host, the Eye is communicative, trying to set the terms of the relationship and explain what activities the Eye favors or abhors.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"The Eye is showing me things. Horrible things.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Vecna believes that the host is unlikely to satisfy its ambitions, so it's actively seeks a better wielder. But it's evil enough to toy with the current host first, even in dangerous situations.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> Once per day at any time, the Eye can induce a horrifying vision in your mind. The Eye makes a special attack against your Will defense, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are stunned (save ends).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>You take a -2 penalty to Diplomacy checks.</p><p>The Eye typically induces a vision during a nonthreatening situation first, trying to force a more compliant attitude from its owner. But the Eye isn't shy about inducing a vision during a combat situation.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"Tear it out! Don't let it see you!\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the Eye of Vecna is at war with its possessor, and it wants to torture its host before moving on to a more acceptable wielder.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> Once per encounter at any time, the Eye can induce a horrifying vision in your mind. The Eye makes a special attack against your Will defense, rolling 1d20 + your level. If this attack hits, you are blinded and stunned (save ends).</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> Each time you make an initiative check at the start of an encounter, there is a 25% chance that the Eye uses eyebite against one of your allies within range of the spell (determined randomly by the DM).</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> The Eye can speak through you whenever you are stunned or unconscious. It can use either your natural voice or a sinister, eerily loud whisper.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>You take a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks.</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"I am Vecna.\"</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of Vecna consumes its owner, body and mind. The character dies instantly, and his body crumbles to dust. Even if the character is raised from the dead, he forever carries an empty eye socket as a souvenir of having once possessed the Eye.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye rejoins its divine namesake. Vecna immediately gains all the knowledge of the former wielder and savors the secrets so acquired. After a time, he sends the Eye back into the world to glean more secrets from other unwitting or greedy arcane characters.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Eye's wielder also bears the Hand of Vecna, that artifact also returns to the god.</p>",

While a creature sleeps, the net is placed over it, and the creature's dreams are absorbed into the net's filaments. When the creature awakens, the net can be boiled in a cauldron or other large vessel. The trapped dreams evaporate into steam that rises in wispy shapes, playing out the events of the dream for any to view.\\nInstead of boiling a net that has captured one creature's dreams in this manner, the user of the net can cut it into small sections and consume a portion to experience the captured dreams directly, allowing the viewer to experience the same set of dreams over time. A dream experienced in this way is more intense and offers deeper insights about the dreamer. A dream that arises from a portion of a net being consumed cannot be captured by another dream net.\\nPublished in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 135.</i></p><p>Made from strands of fey spider silk, a spiderweb dream net is used to capture dreams for varied uses.

			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>This ornate deck of twenty-two cards is a tool of the forces of chaos and anarchy. It frequently appears when the world has grown too calm, or when someone has grown too powerful, and it sows chaos wherever it lands.</i></p><p>The Deck of Many Things is a +3 magic tome implement with the following properties and powers.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Implement:</b> Tome</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Enhancement:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +3d12 damage</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>Sorcerers with the Chaos Power class feature can use the Deck of Many Things as an implement for sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers.</li><li>You cannot be dominated.</li></ul><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Encounter (Free Action)</b></p><p>You alter the fortunes of your enemies, forcing an enemy to reroll one attack roll, skill check, or saving throw it just made, taking the result you choose.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>Roll a d20. Once before the end of the encounter, you can replace any d20 roll made by an ally or an enemy within 5 squares of you with your d20 roll.</p><p>The Deck of Many Things holds within it the potential for both great ruin and great reward. Though its true origins have been lost to the ages, many historians believe that the artifact was originally a gift from a powerful and ancient archfey to a long-forgotten emperor. The archfey knew that the emperor was extremely superstitious and could not resist reading his own fortunes within the cards. The Deck of Many Things might be responsible for shattering that ancient empire and giving rise to powerful warlords that vied for control of its remnants.<bt/>The Deck passes from hand to hand, bringing low the mighty and elevating the meek (or the other way around). While each of its cards grants its user certain powers, when the twenty-two cards are brought together, the complete Deck is an artifact implement that imbues its possessor with many benefits.</p><h2>Goals of the Deck of Many Things</h2><ul><li>Sow chaos and discord throughout the world.</li><li>Be present at events of great importance, and then add a chaotic element to the proceedings of those events to alter everyone's fortunes.</li><li>Topple powerful leaders (good or evil) and cause farreaching organizations to crumble.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Deck of Many Things</h2><p>The Deck of Many Things is an agent of chaos that does its work subtly, through those who possess it. The Deck wants to use its owner as its agent, making temptation its greatest weapon. Whenever the owner is contemplating a risky action, it might try to tempt that character with the suggestion that taking the risk would be a good idea—even if the chances of success are slim.<bt/>The Deck never communicates overtly, but occasionally the top card might flip over on its own to reveal whether the artifact is pleased or displeased (this action does not trigger the Deck's drawn card effect).<bt/>Additionally, while the owner is holding the Deck, that character occasionally sees visions of multiple possible outcomes of any given action, showing the way luck will affect the outcome.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><p>An artifact's concordance score measures its attitude toward its owner. The Deck of Many Things starts with a concordance of 5 when an adventurer takes possession of it, with a likely modifier of +5 because the adventurers have just reassembled its scattered cards. Various actions and events increase or decrease its concordance as long as the adventurer possesses the Deck. When the artifact is pleased with its owner's actions, its concordance goes up. When the owner acts contrary to the Deck's desires, its concordance decreases.<bt/>The Deck's concordance determines its general attitude toward the owner, from angered (concordance 0 or lower) to pleased (concordance 16 or higher). Its attitude, in turn, determines some of its properties and powers, as described below.<bt/>The owner knows of the factors that alter the Deck's concordance—it's in the artifact's best interests to communicate its desires and expectations. But keep the Deck's actual concordance score a secret, telling the player only if its powers or properties change. The player shouldn't ever know exactly how close the artifact is to changing its attitude.</p><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner has reassembled the cards of the Deck</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level </td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is unaligned</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner has the fey origin</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is reduced to 0 hit points</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner overthrows a ruler or powerful leader</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner obtains a magic item</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner goes a day without using an arcane power</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"Hmm, seems like the cards are falling in my favor these days.\"</i><bt/>When the owner has finally done the Deck's bidding, or enough of it anyway, the Deck gives the owner the chance to draw from it with better-than-average odds of avoiding the more ruinous cards.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die, reroll that die until you roll a result other than 1.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\").</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"There's wisdom in the cards, if only you could see it.\"</i><bt/>The Deck is pleased with the chaos that the owner is sowing, and begins trying to tempt that character into drawing from it by sweetening the deal.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die (except a d20), reroll that die until you roll a result other than 1.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\").</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"Curious—the cards show me how big a role luck plays in our lives.\"</i><bt/>When first drawn from its container, the Deck conveys little more than a sense that much in the world is a matter of luck and not skill.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You draw a card from the Deck of Many Things and then resolve the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\").</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"I'm afraid that this might not be a lucky time for me.\"</i><bt/>An owner who rejects the Deck's desires soon experiences a streak of bad, if harmless, luck. The bad luck is an inconvenience for now, but the Deck wants to make sure the owner knows it is displeased.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>Any time you roll the maximum result on a die (except a d20), treat the result as a 1 instead.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor, if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\").</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"The Deck shows me dark portents; my future is looking grim.\"</i><bt/>An angered Deck of Many Things can be a dangerous item indeed. Anyone drawing from the Deck at this point is extremely likely to suffer ill luck.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>Any time you roll the maximum result on a die, treat the result as a 1 instead.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor, if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see \"Moving On\").</p><h2>Moving On</h2><p><i>\"It's gone! Vanished into thin air!\"</i><bt/>The Deck of Many Things fades in and out of history, wreaking havoc and upsetting the order of things from time to time. It is an agent of chaos in an otherwise ordered world, and once someone has drawn from the complete Deck it vanishes, never to be seen again by that person.</p><h2>The Complete Deck</h2><p>Each card drawn from the complete Deck of Many Things has a special effect that triggers when it is drawn. Though the concordance score of the artifact determines how many cards are drawn, only one card is triggered each draw. The effect of the drawn card is described below. (Drawing a card from an incomplete Deck has a lesser effect, as described in \"Card Effects.\")<bt/>Eleven of the cards have the Ruin descriptor. This helps determine which card's effect comes into play when the Deck of Many Things is unsatisfied or angered. Cards with a generally beneficial effect have the Reward descriptor, which does not affect card draws.</p><h3>Balance</h3><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Ruin</b></p><p>You have been judged—and found wanting.

			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>One of five tools given to the first dwarves by Moradin, the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords appears in times of great crisis—often in the hands of a champion destined to save the dwarf people.</i></p><p>The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a +5 thundering greataxe with the following properties and powers.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Enhancement:</b> Attack rolls and damage rolls</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +5d6 damage, or +5d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Properties</b></p><ul><li>This weapon deals an extra 2d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size.</li><li>You can throw the Axe as a heavy thrown weapon (range 5/10). It returns to your hand after being thrown as normal for a magic thrown weapon.</li><li>You can speak and understand the Dwarven language and read the Davek script.</li></ul><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power (Divine, Healing) ✦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p>You can use death ward (paladin 16).</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Free Action)</b></p><p>You can use this power when you hit an enemy with the Axe. The enemy is knocked prone. That enemy's space, and all squares within 2 squares of the enemy, crack and fracture into rubble and become difficult terrain until the end of the encounter. You and your allies can move through this terrain as if it were normal.</p><h2>Goals of the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</h2><ul><li>Help the dwarves flourish in keeping with their ancient traditions.</li><li>Give goblins and (especially) giants the deaths they so richly deserve.</li><li>Become an inspiration to honorable people everywhere.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords</h2><p>The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is taciturn—even by the standards of sentient weapons from the mists of ancient history. It communicates in gruff commands only its bearer can hear. It urges its bearer to battle any giants encountered, becoming sullen when refused this honor.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is a dwarf</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner completes a quest on behalf of dwarf leaders</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner kills a giant (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner or an ally attacks a dwarf (max. 1/encounter)</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner disobeys a directive from dwarf leaders</td><td>-2</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"A thousand dwarf ancestors guide the path of this blade. I'm just one in an unbroken line of champions.\"</i><bt/>The Axe is clearly in tune with its wielder at this point, and together they're doing the will of the dwarves.</p><p>The Axe's enhancement bonus increases to +6.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +6d6 damage, or +6d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> An exarch or angel in the service of Moradin might occasionally emerge from the Axe to give you prophetic guidance or send you on a quest. It won't fight for you.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>This weapon deals an extra 3d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You call forth an aura of thunder (aura 1) that lasts until the end of your next turn. Any enemy that starts its turn within the aura takes 15 thunder damage and is knocked prone.</p><h3>Satisfied (12–15)</h3><p><i>\"Quail in fear, giants! This Axe has spilled the blood of your savage ancestors.\"</i><bt/>The wielder has proved to be a worthy representative of the dwarves, and the Axe does its wielder's bidding as long as the bearer remains worthy of its trust.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power ✦ Daily (Minor Action)</b></p><p>You can heal yourself, regaining hit points as if you spent a healing surge.</p><h3>Normal (5–11)</h3><p><i>\"The Axe asks for my fealty to the dwarves.\"</i><bt/>The Axe is reserved and cautious with a new wielder until the character proves his worth and dedication.</p><h3>Unsatisfied (1–4)</h3><p><i>\"I'm disappointing the Axe—and the dwarves.\"</i><bt/>The wielder is fighting dwarves or disobeying their legitimate leaders, and the Axe is not pleased. If the wielder doesn't change his ways, the Axe soon leaves.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creatures other than goblins or giants. This applies whether you are using or even holding the Axe.</p><h3>Angered (0 or lower)</h3><p><i>\"I have failed it—the Axe is not pleased.\"</i><bt/>The wielder is not meeting the Axe's expectations, and it will not remain in his possession for long.</p><p>The Axe's enhancement bonus drops to +4.</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Critical:</b> +4d6 damage, or +4d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size</p><p class=\"basics\"><b>Special:</b> You take a -5 penalty to attack rolls and damage rolls against any creatures other than goblins or giants. This applies regardless if you are using or even holding the Axe.</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>This weapon deals an extra 2d10 damage against creatures larger than Medium size.</p><h3>Moving On</h3><p><i>\"The Axe tells me it's needed elsewhere now.\"</i><bt/>The Axe wants to go where it's most useful, and at some point it knows that it's more needed in other hands. When the character next gains a level, the Axe disappears, its sentience and other abilities traveling to another land for a new hero to discover. If the Axe is at least satisfied, it leaves behind a normal +6 thundering greataxe for its champion to wield in its stead.</p>",

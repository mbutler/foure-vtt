			"value":"<p class=\"flavour\"><i>At first glance, this artifact appears as an adamantine platebarded warhorse of particularly powerful build, but further inspection reveals that the entire horse is made of metal and is powered by gears and hidden arcane devices. Due to the genius of its craftsmanship, its noble form moves naturally despite its unyielding material.</i></p><p>Wondrous Item</p><p class=\"subheading\"><b>Property</b></p><p>The Adamantine Horse of Xarn is a construct in the form of a warhorse that serves as a mount for its owner. Its statistics depend upon its concordance with its owner.</p><h2>Goals of the Adamantine Horse</h2><ul><li>Serve as a mount for a hero devoted to the tenets of law and good.</li><li>Protect the weak and uphold justice for the innocent.</li><li>Fight against tyranny and greed, especially that perpetrated by chromatic dragons.</li></ul><h2>Roleplaying the Adamantine Horse</h2><p>If it is owned by a character who shares its philosophy and helps it to achieve its goals, the Adamantine Horse of Xarn is a stalwart companion, providing timely aid to its owner. The Adamantine Horse can be extremely stubborn, however, with a character who is less perfectly aligned with its goals. The Adamantine Horse can't communicate with its rider verbally, but it understands Draconic, Common, and Supernal, and it makes its desires known with a gentle (or not so gentle) nudge, a derisive whinny, or the placement of its metal body to block or reroute passage.</p><h2>Concordance</h2><table><tr><th>Starting Score</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>Owner gains a level</td><td>+1d10</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is lawful good</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner is a paladin, warlord, or avenger</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner has the Mounted Combat feat</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner finishes a quest that fulfills the Adamantine Horse's goals</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner defeats an evil dragon (maximum 1/day)</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Owner acts in a way contrary to the Adamantine Horse's goals</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Owner disregards the Adamantine Horse's desires</td><td>-1</td></tr></table><br/></p><h3>Pleased (16-20)</h3><p><i>\"On the battlefield, we move and fight as one.\"</i><bt/>The Adamantine Horse of Xarn is proud to serve its owner as a steed and ally in battle, and it shares its magical power with its owner's allies as well.

If it has normal concordance with its owner, it walks off into the sunset the next time the character gains a level, never to be seen again. If it's satisfied or pleased with its owner, it leaves behind a celestial charger (Monster Manual, page 159) that serves the Adamantine Horse's former owner faithfully. If the artifact is angered or unsatisfied, it leaves its owner at an inconvenient time to emphasize its disappointment and displeasure with the character's actions.</p>",

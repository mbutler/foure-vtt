Replace the terrain in the blast with the following terrain and effects:</p><p>*: The heaps of treasure are difficult terrain, and any creature that enters a square of treasure must make a DC 28 Acrobatics check, or the pile slides the creature 1 square and knocks it prone. Like the rest of the immurement's effects, all the treasure vanishes at the end of the encounter.</p><p>*: The pool is 20 feet deep. Once per encounter, when you start your turn submerged in the pool and bloodied, you regain hit points as if you had spent a healing surge.</p><p>*: At the start of your turn, lightning arcs between the stalactites as shown on the map. Make an attack against each creature in a square crossed by an arc: +31 vs. Reflex; 2d10 + 10 lightning damage. A creature can be attacked in this way only once per turn.</p><p>*: Each heap of treasure is surrounded by a field of grasping draconic claws, as marked on the map. When any enemy enters a square containing claws, the claws make an opportunity attack: Melee touch; +33 vs. AC; 1d12 + 5 damage, and claws grab the target (DC 28 Athletics or Acrobatics to escape). A creature can attack a square of claws (AC 38, other defenses 36, and 50 hit points). Destroying the square also releases a creature grabbed by it.</p>",

			"value":"<p class=\"subheading\"><b>Power âœ¦ Daily (Standard Action)</b></p><p><b>Effect</b>: By peering into the crystal ball, you can get a glimpse of a creature, object, or location within 100 squares of you. When you view a subject through the crystal ball, you see and hear the immediate area around the subject until the end of your next turn as if you were standing beside it. Your perception of the area is with your normal senses and vision, and you might need to make Perception checks to note specific features of the area. If the subject moves, your point of perception moves with it. A creature being scried upon, or within 5 squares of the subject being viewed with the crystal ball, can make a Perception check opposed by your Arcana check. On a successful Perception check, the creature is aware that it is being magically observed, and it might take steps to thwart your observation. However, it is not automatically aware that you are the one observing it.</p><p><b>Level 18</b>: The subject of your scrying can be within 100 miles of your location.</p><p><b>Level 28</b>: The subject of your scrying can be anywhere on your plane.</p><p><b>Sustain Standard</b>: The effect persists until the end of your next turn.</p>",

When your pact boon is triggered or when you use your eyes of the vestige power, you choose which vestige's benefit applies. </p><p>If you would ordinarily be required to choose between the two primary vestiges, this feat enables you to have both of them as active vestiges. If you use a daily attack power that gives you access to a new vestige, you can choose for that daily power vestige to replace either of your two active vestiges. </p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 133. </p>",

Add that vestige to your list of primary vestiges. You can now select this as your active vestige any time that you are allowed to change your vestige. </p><p>Each time you learn a new warlock daily attack power, you can change the vestige granted by this feat. If you swap out the power with which this vestige is associated, you lose this feat's benefit until you reassign the benefit to a new warlock daily attack power that grants access to a vestige. </p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 135. </p>",

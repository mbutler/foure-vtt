			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>You have a spellscar </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>You gain the ability to focus your spellscar to useful ends. You qualify for the Novice Power, Acolyte Power, and Adept Power feats, treating spellscarred as the class into which you have multiclassed. You also choose one trait from the following list. (Your DM might create other traits to add to this list, or allow you to devise one of your own.) </p><p>- Sight of the Unseen: You have darkvision extending 1 square in all directions that you can turn on and off at will. When your darkvision is on, your eyes are backlit with a dancing blue flame. </p><p>- Flamespeed: Once per encounter as a minor action, you gain a +1 bonus to speed or a +2 bonus to speed if you charge or run. The bonus lasts until the end of your next turn. Blue flame momentarily licks the ground where your feet touch it. </p><p>- Larger than Life: Once per day as a free action, your hands flare with a blue glow and you add 1 to the reach of an attack you make. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 41, 139. </p>",

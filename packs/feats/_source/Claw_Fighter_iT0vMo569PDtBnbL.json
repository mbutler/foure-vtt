			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Gnoll </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>When you make a weapon attack, you can use your claw, which is a weapon in the light blade weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d6 damage. While you aren't holding anything, you are considered have this weapon in each hand. You can enchant and disenchant your claws. When you disenchant your claws, they do not turn to dust. </p><p>Update (2/8/2010) </p><p>Replace the feat's Benefit text with the following text, incorporating the December changes. This change revises the claws to have the off-hand property, synchronizing it with the monk and resolving issues with how it is possible to wield two non-off-hand weapons. However, this change does fix issues with the swordmage, which requires a hand free to gain the benefit of its aegis. As the text stands, a gnoll with this feat cannot gain the +3 benefit of the aegis because it is considered to always have a weapon in each hand. </p><p>\"When you make a weapon attack, you can use your claw, which is a weapon in the light blade weapon group.

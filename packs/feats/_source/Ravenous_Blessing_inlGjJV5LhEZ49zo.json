This damage cannot be decreased in any way. If you choose to take necrotic damage, one ally affected by the power regains hit points equal to your level. If you have the Student of the Plague feat, an ally who regains hit points from this feat also gains a +2 power bonus to saving throws until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 25. </p>",

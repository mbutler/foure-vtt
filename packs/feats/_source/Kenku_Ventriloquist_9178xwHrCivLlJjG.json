			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Kenku, trained in Bluff </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>When you speak or use your Mimicry racial feature, you can make the sound seem to originate from a square within 5 squares of you. You must succeed on a Bluff check to fool listeners into believing the sound came from that location. If the square is occupied by a creature, that creature knows it didn't make the sound, and you take a -2 penalty to the Bluff check against other listeners. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 411. </p>",

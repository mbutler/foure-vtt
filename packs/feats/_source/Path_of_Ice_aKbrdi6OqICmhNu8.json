One creature adjacent to you before or after the shift takes cold damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. The cold damage equals 3 + your Wisdom modifier at 11th level, and 6 + your Wisdom modifier at 21st level. </p><p>If you are in the aspect of the elements, you shift 2 squares. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 393. </p>",

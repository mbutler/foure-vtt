You can perform the Bloom ritual in 5 minutes, including during a short rest, and you need no ritual book to do so. Performing the ritual during a short rest does not prevent you from resting. If a creature in the ritual's affected area spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier with each healing surge. </p><p>In addition, you can perform the Bloom ritual once per day without expending ritual components. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 412. </p>",

			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Swordmage </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>You have a spellbook in which you record your swordmage spells. </p><p>When you choose this feat, select a second swordmage daily attack power for each level at which you already know a swordmage daily attack power, and add those powers to your spellbook. After an extended rest, you can prepare a number of daily spells according to what you can cast per day for your level. You can't prepare the same spell twice. </p><p>Whenever you learn a new level of swordmage daily attack powers, add two different swordmage daily attack spells of that level to your spellbook. </p><p>If you retrain a daily swordmage attack power, you replace only one of your two choices for that level. If you replace the power with a power from a different class (through multiclassing) or a swordmage daily attack power of a higher level, you replace both spell choices with the new power or powers. </p><p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 136. </p>",

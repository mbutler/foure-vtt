			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Dex 13, eladrin, wizard </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>You can wield a longsword as an implement when using wizard powers. Your longsword adds its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when used as an implement. You do not gain your weapon proficiency bonus to the attack roll when you use your longsword as an implement. </p><p>If you have any feats or class features that apply a benefit when you wield a wand, you can also apply these benefits when you wield a longsword. If such benefits apply to attacks, they apply only when you use the longsword as an implement for a wizard attack power. </p><p>Published in Arcane Power, page(s) 125. </p>",

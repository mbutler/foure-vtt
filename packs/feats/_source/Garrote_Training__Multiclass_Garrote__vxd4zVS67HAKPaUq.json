			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Str 13, Dex 13 </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>You gain proficiency with the garrote. When you use a garrote to successfully grab a target, the target takes a -2 penalty to escape the grab. Each turn you successfully maintain a grab with a garrote used with two hands, you have combat advantage against the target you're grabbing for the purpose of attacking again with the garrote. </p><p>If you are a rogue, you can use the garrote with the Sneak Attack class feature and any rogue melee attack power that can be used with a light blade. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 373, page(s) 15. </p>",

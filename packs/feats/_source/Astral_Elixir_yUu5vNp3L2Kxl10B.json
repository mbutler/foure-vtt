The radiant resistance is equal to the resistance ordinarily granted by the power and has the same duration. </p><p>When making a saving throw, the target can end the shielding elixir effect as a free action to add 1d6 to the saving throw result instead of gaining the normal benefit for ending the effect. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 387, page(s) 31. </p>",

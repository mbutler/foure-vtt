			"value":"<p><b>Prerequisite: </b>Warlock, Sorcerer-King Pact class feature, Balican Praetor feat </p><p><b>Benefit: </b>Whenever an enemy you have cursed drops to 0 hit points, you gain the following benefit in addition to regaining the use of your fell might. The next ally you can see that hits with a damaging attack before the start of your next turn subjects its target to your Warlock's Curse. If the target is already under your curse, the ally's attack instead deals extra damage equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. </p><p>You can augment powers associated with this feat with your fell might. When you hit an enemy with an augmented power associated with this feat, each ally adjacent to the target can either shift 1 square as a free action or gain a +2 power bonus to all defenses until the start of your next turn. </p><p>Finally, you can use Charisma instead of Constitution for attack rolls and damage rolls with any power associated with this feat. </p><p>Associated Powers: </p><p>Awaken the Dragon </p><p>, </p><p>Fortune Binding </p><p>, </p><p>Hero's Arrow </p><p>, </p><p>Life Force Reclaimed </p><p>, </p><p>Shattering of the Sword </p><p>, </p><p>Skirmisher's Volley </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 390. </p>",

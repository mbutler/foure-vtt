They have large horns; thick, nonprehensile tails that range in length from four to five feet; sharply pointed teeth; and eyes that are solid orbs of black, red, white, silver, or gold. Their skin color covers the whole human range and also extends to reds, from a ruddy tan to a brick red. Their hair, cascading down behind their horns, is as likely to be dark blue, red, or purple as more common human colors.</p>\n<p>Tieflings favor dark colors and reds, leathers and glossy furs, small spikes and buckles. Tiefling-crafted arms and armor often have an archaic style, harkening back to the glory of their long-vanished empire.</p>\n<p>Tieflings have the same life spans and general aging patterns as humans.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>PLAYING A TIEFLING</h3>\n<p>Heirs to an ancient, infernal bloodline, tieflings have no realms of their own but instead live within human kingdoms and cities. They are descended from human nobles who bargained with dark powers, and whose empire once subjugated half the world. But the empire was cast down into ruin, and tieflings were left to make their own way in a world that often fears and resents them.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of years ago, the leaders of the human empire of Bael Turath made pacts with devils to solidify their hold over its enormous territory. Those humans became the first tieflings, and they governed their empire in the name of their infernal masters. In time, Bael Turath came into conflict with Arkhosia, the ancient empire of the dragonborn, and decades of warfare left both empires in ruins. Bael Turath's grand capital was thrown down in ruin.</p>\n<p>Following the collapse of their empire, the tieflings were scattered. Bearing the infernal visage that was the mark of their pact with the forces of darkness, they found a cold and sometimes deadly welcome in the humanoid societies to which they fled. Once a powerful people with a strong nobility, the tieflings were reduced to little more than vagabonds. Their population dwindled, and for many decades, the survivors of Bael Turath were in danger of being wiped out and forgotten.</p>\n<p>Over time, however, the last of the great Turathi nobles began to reclaim their place in the world. Cautiously earning the trust of other peoples, the descendants of those nobles began to spread into human communities that were willing to allow them to live in peace, and the tiefling race was reborn. In the present age, tieflings are less common than many other races, but their numbers grow stronger with each generation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tiefling Characteristics </strong>: Cunning, disquieting, imposing, mysterious, proud, rebellious, self-reliant, sinister, sly, unconventional</p>\n<p><strong>Tiefling Male Names </strong>: Akmenos, Amnon, Art, Barakas, Carrion, Chant, Damakos, Despair, Ekemon, Fear, Gladness, Hope, Iados, Ideal, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Morthos, Music, Nowhere, Open, Pelaios, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Skamos, Sorrow, Therai, Torment, Weary</p>\n<p><strong>Tiefling Female Names </strong>: Akta, Art, Bryseis, Carrion, Chant, Damaia, Despair, Ea, Fear, Gladness, Hope, Ideal, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Music, Nemeia, Nowhere, Open, Orianna, Phelaia, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Rieta, Sorrow, Torment, Weary</p>\n<p>Update (11/16/2010)</p>\n<p>Updated to match Essentials data.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 48, Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, page(s) 270.</p>",

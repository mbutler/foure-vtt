The valor of dauntless heroes and the cunning of great minds are among these virtues, and a bard can choose to emphasize either quality.</p>\n<p>Choose one of the following options. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain bard powers, as detailed in those powers.</p>\n<p>Virtue of Cunning; Virtue of Prescience; Virtue of Valor; </p>\n<p><strong>Song Of Rest </strong></p>\n<p>When you play an instrument or sing during a short rest, you and each ally who can hear you are affected by your Song of Rest. When an affected character spends healing surges at the end of the rest, that character regains additional hit points equal to your Charisma modifier with each healing surge. A character can be affected by only one Song of Rest at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Words Of Friendship </strong></p>\n<p>You gain the words of friendship power.</p>\n<p>Words of Friendship; </p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>The bard and warlock classes make a good hybrid combination, with complete overlap between primary and secondary abilities. Focus on ranged implement attacks when choosing bard powers.</p>\n<p>A bard/paladin can mix leadership and defense and maintain accuracy with Charisma attack powers. You'll need a little help with AC, particularly if you're the only defender in the group.</p>\n<p>Combining a bard with a warlord can create a leader who has powers that move allies and enemies around the battlefield with ease.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 141.</p>",

This means you meet prerequisites that require the pact you choose, and you can use the benefits tailored for it in certain powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Warlock's Curse (Hybrid) </strong></p>\n<p>This class feature functions as the warlock class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when you hit a cursed enemy with a warlock power or a warlock paragon path power.</p>\n<p>Warlock's Curse; </p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid talent Options</strong></p>\n<p>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.</p>\n<p><strong>Prime Shot </strong></p>\n<p>If none of your allies are nearer to your target than you are, you receive a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls against that target. You do not gain this feature if you choose the Beast Mastery fighting style.</p>\n<p><strong>Shadow Walk </strong></p>\n<p>On your turn, if you move at least 3 squares away from where you started your turn, you gain concealment until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Warlock Pact Boon </strong></p>\n<p>You gain the Pact Boon associated with your Eldritch Pact.</p>\n<p>To select this option, you must have selected the at-will attack power associated with your pact. If you later retrain that power, you lose the benefit of this option.</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>A sorcerer/warlock can be a potent striker, with Charisma as the highest ability score.</p>\n<p>Combining the warlock with the wizard creates a synergistic power list, and the wizard's key ability, Intelligence, is a good secondary ability for the warlock.</p>\n<p>A combination of warlock and bard works quite well, thanks to the ability score overlap of the two classes and the diversity of their power selection.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 153.</p>",

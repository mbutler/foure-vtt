This power counts as assassin's strike for purposes of feats and paragon path features. If you already have assassin's strike and an encounter attack power from your other hybrid class, then instead of choosing or replacing an encounter attack power, you can increase the extra damage dealt by your assassin's strike by 1d10.</p>\n<p>Assassin's Strike (Hybrid);</p>\n<p><strong>Attack Finesse (Hybrid) </strong></p>\n<p>You gain the benefit of the executioner's Attack Finesse class feature, except that you can deal the extra damage only when using the required weapons with basic attacks, assassin powers, and assassin paragon path powers.</p>\n<p><strong>Guild Attacks (Hybrid) </strong></p>\n<p>You choose a guild and gain the benefit of the Guild Attacks class feature, except that you choose only two of the at-will attack powers associated with your guild.</p>\n<p>League of Whispers (Hybrid); Bola Takedown; Precision Dart; Quick Shot; Red Scales (Hybrid); Garrote Strangle; Poisoned Dagger; Quick Lunge;</p>\n<p><strong>Poison Use (Hybrid)</strong><br>You gain the benefit of the Poison Use class feature, with the following exception. You do not start with access to any poison recipes. When you gain a daily attack power, you can instead opt to learn a poison recipe. When you replace a daily attack power, you can instead replace one of your poison recipes with one of a higher level or with a daily attack power from your other hybrid class. The recipe's level must be less than or equal to your level. For each daily attack power you forgo, you can prepare one poison per day.<br><br><strong>Hybrid talent Options</strong><br>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br><br><strong>Flawless Disguise (Hybrid)</strong><br>You must be at least 8th level to choose this option.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a short rest, you can craft an excellent disguise that makes you appear to be another humanoid of your size (either a specific person or a nondescript member of a race or an organization). Any creature that attempts to see through your ruse makes an Insight check opposed by your Bluff check, with a +5 bonus to your check. You must use a disguise kit to create the disguise.<br><br><strong>Nimble Drop (Hybrid)</strong><br>You must be at least 4th level to choose this option.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you take falling damage, you can take a free action to reduce the damage by 6 + your level. If this reduces the damage to 0, you don't fall prone.</p>\n<p>Published in Dragon Magazine 400.</p>",

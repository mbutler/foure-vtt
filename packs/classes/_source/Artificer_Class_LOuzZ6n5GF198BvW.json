			"value":"<p><strong>Role: </strong>Leader. You channel arcane power into items that empower your allies and hinder your enemies. You lean toward controller as a secondary role.</p>\n<p><strong>Power Source: </strong>Arcane. The cryptic formulas of arcane magic and the complex recipes of alchemy appeal to you. You are especially knowledgeable about magic items.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Abilities: </strong>Intelligence, Constitution, Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Proficiencies: </strong>Cloth, leather.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Proficiencies: </strong>Simple melee, simple ranged.</p>\n<p><strong>Implement: </strong>Rods, staffs, wands</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus to Defense: </strong>+1 Fortitude, +1 Will.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level </strong>: 12+ Constitution Score.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points per Level Gained </strong>: 5</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Surges per Day </strong>: 6+ Constitution Modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Trained Skills </strong>: Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 4 more trained skills at 1st level.</p>\n<p><em>Class Skills </em>: Arcana (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Dungeoneering (Wis), Heal (Wis), History (Int), Perception (Wis), Thievery (Dex).</p>\n<p><strong>Build Options: </strong>Battlesmith Artificer, Tinkerer Artificer, Warrior Forge Artificer.</p>\n<p><strong>Class features: </strong>Arcane Empowerment, Arcane Rejuvenation, Healing Infusion, Ritual Casting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>ARTIFICER CLASS FEATURES </strong></p>\n<p>You have the following class features.</p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Empowerment </strong></p>\n<p>Your study of magic has given you the ability to manipulate the arcane energy contained within items. You begin each day with the ability to empower a magic item, and you gain one additional arcane empowerment for each milestone you reach. You must spend a short rest with an item in order to empower it. You can empower an item in two ways.</p>\n<p>Augment Energy; Impart Energy; </p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Rejuvenation </strong></p>\n<p>Before combat, an artificer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with curative energy. Whenever one of the artificer's allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally absorbs the energy and gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Infusion </strong></p>\n<p>You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions.</p>\n<p>You determine the effect of a healing infusion at the time you use the power, not at the time you create it. When you use a Healing Infusion power, you expend one of the infusions you created during your last extended rest. During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish one of the infusions expended.</p>\n<p>When you create an artificer, you can choose to take the shielding elixir power in place of the resistive formula power. If you do so, the shielding elixir healing infusion functions exactly as other healing infusions do, with regards to their use and replenishment. If you choose the shielding elixir infusion, you cannot create the resistive formula healing infusion at all.</p>\n<p>Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture; Healing Infusion: Resistive Formula; Healing Infusion: Shielding Elixir; </p>\n<p><strong>Ritual Casting </strong></p>\n<p>You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat, allowing you to use magical rituals.</p>\n<p>RITUAL BOOK</p>\n<p>You own a ritual book, and it contains the following rituals that you have mastered: Brew Potion, Disenchant Magic Item, Enchant Magic Item, and Make Whole. In addition, you can use Disenchant Magic Item without expending components.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>IMPLEMENTS </strong></p>\n<p>Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword.</p>\n<p>Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does.</p>\n<p>Published in Eberron Player's Guide, page(s) 44.</p>",

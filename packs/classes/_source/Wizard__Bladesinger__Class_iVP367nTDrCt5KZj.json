You gain proficiency with that weapon as an implement, meaning you can use your implement powers through it. The weapon also counts as a wand for you, although it can be enchanted only as a weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Bladesinger Cantrips </strong></p>\n<p>You gain three cantrips of your choice:<em>Ghost Sound, Light, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Suggestion, Disrupt Undead, </em>or<em>Spook </em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Bladesinger's Spellbook </strong></p>\n<p>As you attain certain levels, you learn two new wizard powers and add them to your spellbook (two wizard utility powers at 2nd level, for instance). At the end of each of your extended rests, you choose a number of wizard powers from your spellbook and prepare them. The number you can prepare is determined by your level.</p>\n<p>The powers that you prepare are the wizard powers that you can use during the coming day, in addition to your at-will attack powers and powers from another source, such as racial powers. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. See the Wizard Powers Learned table for the levels at which you add wizard powers to your spellbook.</p>\n<p>Any wizard encounter attack power that you add to your spellbook through this class feature functions as a daily attack power for you. In other words, you can use it once per day, rather than once per encounter, and you can use the power again only after an extended rest. Because the power functions as a daily attack power, you cannot regain its use from any effect that recharges encounter attack powers.</p>\n<p>Find your level on the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many wizard encounter attack powers and wizard utility powers you can prepare each day. (The table does not account for powers that you might have from another source, such as a paragon path.) You cannot prepare more than one attack power and one utility power of any given level on the same day.</p>\n<p>WIZARD POWERS LEARNED</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Encounter as Daily </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Utility </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-8</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-14</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17-18</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20-21</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23-24</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26-28</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>WIZARD POWERS PREPARED PER DAY</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Encounter as Daily </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Utility </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2-4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6-8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-15</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16-21</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22-30</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Bladesong </strong></p>\n<p>You gain the bladesong power.</p>\n<p>Bladesong; </p>\n<p><strong>Bladespells </strong></p>\n<p>You gain three wizard at-will attack powers that have the bladespell keyword.</p>\n<p>Dancing Fire; Dazzling Sunray; Frost Bite; Lightning Ring; Shadow Sever; Unseen Hand; </p>\n<p><strong>Guarded Flourish </strong></p>\n<p>Your ranged attacks and area attacks do not provoke opportunity attacks while you are holding a one-handed melee weapon.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain a +2 shield bonus to AC while you are wearing light armor or no armor and are holding a one-handed melee weapon in one hand and no weapon or shield in the other.</p>\n<p><strong>Instinctive Attack </strong></p>\n<p>When you make a melee basic attack with a weapon you wield in one hand, you can use Intelligence instead of Strength for the attack roll and the damage roll.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Missile </strong></p>\n<p>You gain the magic missile power.</p>\n<p>Magic Missile; </p>\n<p><strong>Level 2: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Level 2 Bladesinger Utility Powers </strong></p>\n<p>You add two 2nd-level wizard utility powers of your choice to your spellbook.</p>\n<p>Expeditious Retreat; Feather Fall; Shield; </p>\n<p><strong>Level 3: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Arcane Strike </strong></p>\n<p>When you use a bladesinger daily attack power on your turn, you can make a melee basic attack as a minor action.</p>\n<p><strong>Level 5: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Level 5 Bladesinger Daily Powers </strong></p>\n<p>You add two new wizard encounter attack powers to your spellbook.

When you use the weapon as an implement, it works like a normal implement, but you gain neither the weapon's proficiency bonus nor its nonmagical properties, such as high crit or versatile. A weapon's range and damage dice are usually irrelevant to implement powers, since such powers tend to specify their range and damage.</p>\n<p>If your chosen blade is magical and you use it as an implement, you can also use its enhancement bonus, critical hit effect, properties, and powers. However, some magic weapons have properties and powers that function only with weapon powers.</p>\n<p>Published in Neverwinter Campaign Setting, page(s) 66.</p>",

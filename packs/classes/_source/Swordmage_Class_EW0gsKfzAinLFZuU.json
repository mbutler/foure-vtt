			"value":"<p><strong>Role: </strong>Defender. You are a melee combatant who uses spells to fight better.</p>\n<p><strong>Power Source: </strong>Arcane. You study ancient magical traditions and practice swordplay, developing arcane powers that work well with your physical attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Abilities: </strong>Intelligence, Strength, Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Proficiencies: </strong>Cloth, leather.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Proficiencies: </strong>Simple melee, simple ranged, military light blade, military heavy blade.</p>\n<p><strong>Implement: </strong>Any light blade or heavy blade</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus to Defense: </strong>+2 Will.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level </strong>: 15+ Constitution Score.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points per Level Gained </strong>: 6</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Surges per Day </strong>: 8+ Constitution Modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Trained Skills </strong>: Arcana. From the class skills list below, choose 3 more trained skills at 1st level.</p>\n<p><em>Class Skills </em>: Arcana (Int), Athletics (Str), Diplomacy (Cha), Endurance (Con), History (Int), Insight (Wis), Intimidate (Cha).</p>\n<p><strong>Build Options: </strong>Assault Swordmage, Ensnaring Swordmage, Shielding Swordmage.</p>\n<p><strong>Class features: </strong>Swordbond, Swordmage Aegis, Swordmage Warding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>SWORDMAGE CLASS FEATURES </strong></p>\n<p>Swordmages are smart, strong bastions of defense whose art is embodied by their swords. All swordmages have the class features described below.</p>\n<p><strong>Swordbond </strong></p>\n<p>By spending 1 hour of meditation with a chosen light or heavy blade, you forge a special bond with the weapon. As a standard action, you can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away.</p>\n<p>You can forge a bond with a different blade using the same meditation process (for instance, if you acquire a new blade that has magical abilities). If you forge a bond with a different blade, the old bond dissipates.</p>\n<p>If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. (This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can't use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.)</p>\n<p><strong>Swordmage Aegis </strong></p>\n<p>You can place a magical warding upon a foe, allowing you to respond to the foe's attacks against your allies with a counterassault or a timely protection. Choose one Aegis and gain its benefit.</p>\n<p>Aegis of Assault; Aegis of Assault; Aegis of Ensnarement; Aegis of Ensnarement; Aegis of Shielding; Aegis of Shielding; </p>\n<p><strong>Swordmage Warding </strong></p>\n<p>While you are conscious and wielding either a light blade or a heavy blade, you maintain a field of magical force around you.</p>\n<p>This field provides a +1 bonus to AC, or a +3 bonus if you are wielding a blade in one hand and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, a two-handed weapon, or anything else).</p>\n<p>SWORDMAGE OVERVIEW</p>\n<p>Your melee skills are most important, but you also have attacks that can hit multiple creatures or injure creatures at range. Your defensive powers can protect your allies and yourself.</p>\n<p>Religion</p>\n<p>Swordmages favor deities of magic or skill. Corellon, Sel&ucirc;ne, Torm, and Tymora are common among swordmages of good heart. Swordmages of a darker bent often revere Shar, regarding their unusual skills as a secret art to be kept hidden from the uninitiated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>IMPLEMENTS </strong></p>\n<p>Your blade adds its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and any extra damage granted by a property (if applicable) when used as an implement. You do not gain your weapon proficiency bonus to the attack roll when using your blade as an implement.</p>\n<p>Published in Forgotten Realms Player's Guide, page(s) 24.</p>",

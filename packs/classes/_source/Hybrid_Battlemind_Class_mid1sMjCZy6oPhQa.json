See \"Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters\" in the glossary to determine the number of power points you have.</p>\n<p><strong>Psionic Defense (Hybrid) </strong></p>\n<p>This class feature functions as the battlemind class feature, except that you must choose either blurred step or mind spike.</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid talent Options</strong></p>\n<p>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.</p>\n<p><strong>Battlemind Armor Proficiency </strong></p>\n<p>You gain proficiency with leather armor, hide armor, chainmail, scale armor, light shields, and heavy shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Psionic Study (Hybrid) </strong></p>\n<p>Battleminds learn to fight using their bodies as weapons. Some battleminds alter their own form to fit their needs. Other battleminds use their psionic power to predict the best position for launching an attack.</p>\n<p>Choose one of these options.</p>\n<p>Battle Resilience (Hybrid); Battle Resilience; Speed of Thought (Hybrid); Speed of Thought; Wild Focus (Hybrid); Wild Focus; Persistent Harrier (Hybrid); Persistent Harrier;</p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations<br>The battlemind/fighter has plenty of durability, but you'll need to assign high scores to both Strength and Constitution, with Wisdom as your third-best score.<br><br>The ardent/battlemind also needs two high scores&mdash;Constitution and Charisma&mdash;but can manage without a third good score. This combination also gives you the full array of power points for your augmentable powers.<br><br>A battlemind/warlock can get away with only one high ability score (Constitution), and Charisma makes a great secondary score for both classes. Unfortunately, you're a little fragile for a defender, so either shore up those defenses or find a tough ally to stand next to.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 142.</p>",

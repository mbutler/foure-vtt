Choose one of the following forms of implement mastery: Orb of Imposition, Staff of Defense, Tome of Binding, Tome of Readiness, Wand of Accuracy.</p>\n<p>Orb of Deception; Orb of Deception; Orb of Imposition; Orb of Imposition; Staff of Defense; Staff of Defense; Tome of Binding; Tome of Readiness; Wand of Accuracy; Wand of Accuracy; </p>\n<p>Suggested Combinations</p>\n<p>As a hybrid wizard, you're not particularly durable, so you must choose your second hybrid class, as well as your powers, with care.</p>\n<p>The swordmage shares the same key ability, but that class's predilection for melee combat is at odds with the typical wizard's preference for staying out of the fray. To keep up in melee, select a good mix of close attack powers and some feats that improve your survivability. Alternatively, focus your swordmage power selection on ranged powers and area powers and enter melee only as a last resort.</p>\n<p>A cleric/wizard who has good Intelligence and Wisdom scores can safely and effectively remain in the back ranks while supporting allies with battlefield control and healing.</p>\n<p>Adding the avenger class to your hybrid wizard allows you to surprise your enemies with the occasional deadly melee attack. Taking Armor of Faith through the Hybrid Talent feat gives you the boost to AC you need to stay close enough to deliver such an attack.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 155.</p>",

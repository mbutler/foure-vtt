You gain only the Flurry of Blows power associated with that option. Your Flurry of Blows power is triggered only when you hit with a monk power or monk paragon path power during your turn. You are considered to have that option for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Centered Breath (Hybrid); Centered Flurry of Blows; Stone Fist (Hybrid); Stone Fist Flurry of Blows; Desert Wind (Hybrid); Desert Wind Flurry of Blows; Eternal Tide (Hybrid); Eternal Tide Flurry of Blows; Iron Soul (Hybrid); Iron Soul Flurry of Blows;</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid talent Options</strong><br>If you take the Hybrid Talent feat, you can select one of the following options.<br><br><strong>Expanded Tradition</strong><br>You gain all the features associated with your Monastic Tradition.<br><br><strong>Unarmed Combatant</strong><br>You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants can. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see &ldquo;Implements&rdquo; below).<br><br><strong>Unarmored Defense</strong><br>While you are wearing cloth armor or no armor and aren't using a shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.<br><br>Suggested Combinations<br>The monk/rogue is an excellent combination, resulting in a character who can use a dagger to deliver flurries and sneak attacks alike. Focus on a good Dexterity score and make Strength second best.<br><br>The avenger/monk combination suggests years of training in a secret monastery dedicated to disciplined vengeance. You'll need a high score in both Dexterity and Wisdom to maximize accuracy.<br><br>The fighter/monk can call out foes for one-on-one battle, and then slip away when things get too rough. Put high scores in both Dexterity and Strength, with Wisdom a strong third score.</p>\n<p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 145.</p>",

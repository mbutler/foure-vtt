If you choose this option, you gain several benefits.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11th level, you can choose to replace one of your at-will powers with an at-will power from your multiclass class.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In place of the paragon path encounter power gained at 11th level, you can select any encounter attack power of 7th level or lower from your multiclass class.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In place of the paragon path utility power gained at 12th level, you can select any utility power of 10th level or lower from your multiclass class.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In place of the paragon path daily power gained at 20th level, you can select any daily attack power of 19th level or lower from your multiclass class.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 209.</p>"

When the creature activates variable resistance, it chooses a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. (The creature can't choose a damage type to which it is vulnerable.) Until the end  of the encounter, the creature gains a specified amount of resistance to that damage type. This  resistance replaces any resistance the creature already had against that damage type. <br/><br/>If a creature can activate variable resistance more than once per encounter, the creature can resist only one damage type at a time using variable resistance. See also resist.</p><p>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 219.</p>"

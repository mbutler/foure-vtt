However, if the creature is climbing or flying, it falls.<br/>✦&nbsp; The only way the creature can move is by crawling, teleporting, or being pulled, pushed, or slid.<br/>✦&nbsp; The creature takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls.<br/>✦&nbsp; The creature grants combat advantage to attackers making melee attacks against it, but it gains a +2 bonus to all defenses against ranged attacks from attackers that aren't adjacent to it.<br/><br/>A creature can end this condition on itself by standing up. A creature can drop prone as a minor action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition can affect limbless creatures, such as fish and snakes, as well as amorphous creatures, such as oozes. When such a creature falls prone, imagine it is writhing or unsteady, rather than literally lying down. The game effect on that creature is the same as for other creatures.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 232, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 124.</p>"

				"content":"<h1>Tattoos</h1><p>Tattoos are marks of group identity that distinguish and empower sects, tribes, guilds, and philosophies. Magic tattoos often interact with characters' intrinsic properties, such as healing surges or action points. However, one's mortal form can only contain a small amount of foreign magic, so a character can only have one magic tattoo at a time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic tattoos may be created using special materials (whether inks, needles, or other means) with the Enchant Magic Item ritual. Tattoo stones can also be found in treasure hordes. These stones allow a single character to transfer the tattoo and its magic by pressing the surface of the stone against his or her skin as part of an extended rest. The tattoo appears on the character's skin where it was applied, and the tattoo stone loses its magic.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic tattoos can be removed only through the use of the Disenchant Magic Item ritual, which requires the bearer of the tattoo to be willing or helpless for the duration of the ritual. At the ritual performer's discretion, the ritual can dissolve the magic and leave the tattoo, or it can remove the art completely.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Published in Adventurer's Vault 2, page(s) 83.</p>"

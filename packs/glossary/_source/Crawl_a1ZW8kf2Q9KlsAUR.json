A creature must be prone to take this action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Move: The creature moves up to half its speed.<br/><br/>Standing up and then moving is usually preferable to crawling, but sometimes a prone creature wants to move and doesn't have enough actions to stand up first. In that situation, crawling and teleporting are the best options.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 288, Rules Compendium, page(s) 241.</p>"

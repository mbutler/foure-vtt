Even then, they receive only one-fifth of an item's market price. Art objects or fine goods that have a specific value, such as a gold dagger worth 100 gp, bring their full stated price. The sale price of a magic item depends on its rarity; see \"Magic Item Values\".</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 265.</p>"

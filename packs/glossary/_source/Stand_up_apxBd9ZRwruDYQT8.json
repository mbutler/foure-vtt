It can't stand up if no unoccupied space is adjacent to it.<br/><br/>Even a prone creature that is limbless or amorphous can take this action, which represents the creature righting itself or regaining its balance rather than literally standing.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 292, Rules Compendium, page(s) 250.</p>"

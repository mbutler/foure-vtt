A creature can talk as a free action, which means that it can speak even on another creature's turn and as often as it likes (within reason), as long as it's able to take free actions.<br/><br/>Talk<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Action: Free action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; No Extended Monologues: A creature can speak freely using this action, but the Dungeon Master can limit the length of a monologue or a conversation that takes place during combat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Includes Other Communication: Creatures that communicate using telepathy or other forms of nonverbal communication also use this action to communicate.</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 251.</p>"

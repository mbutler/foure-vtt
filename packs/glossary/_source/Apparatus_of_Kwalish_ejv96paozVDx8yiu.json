Kwalish, a wizard skilled in architecture and arcane engineering, built the original apparatus to explore the ocean depths and establish ties with sentient aquatic races. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hatch situated beneath the apparatus's tail opens into its hollow central torso. This space holds two chairs for a driver and a passenger. The apparatus is propelled magically through water of any depth or current. It can traverse the swiftest rivers and descend to the depths of the ocean floor.</p><p>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 20.</p>"

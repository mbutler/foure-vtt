The new effect, specified in a \"First Failed Saving Throw\" or a \"Second Failed Saving Throw\" entry, takes effect after the target fails a saving throw against the previous effect at the end of the target's turn. The effect doesn't change if the creature fails a saving throw against it at a time other than the end of its turn.</p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 373.</p>"

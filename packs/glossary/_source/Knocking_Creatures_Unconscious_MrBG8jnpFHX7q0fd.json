Until it regains hit points, the creature is unconscious but not dying. Any healing makes the creature conscious.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the creature doesn't receive any healing, after a short rest it is restored to 1 hit point and becomes conscious.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 295, Rules Compendium, page(s) 261.</p>"

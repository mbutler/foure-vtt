For instance, tremorsense allows a creature to sense something on the other side of a wall, as long as the creature and the thing are both in contact with the ground or the wall. Tremorsense usually has a radius, beyond which the creature relies on its other senses.</p><p>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 219, Monster Manual, page(s) 283, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 223, Divine Power, page(s) 159, Rules Compendium, page(s) 317.</p>"

However, you can renew this item's power by taking a standard action to funnel your vitality into the item, spending a healing surge in the process. Spending a healing surge in this way does not restore hit points, and this standard action is separate from the action required to activate the item's power.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 226.</p>"

				"content":"<h1>Wands</h1><p>A wand is a slender, tapered piece of wood, enchanted to channel arcane energy.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a wand's power works like using the power normally. To do so, you need to be able to use at least one power from the same power source as the wand power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also design your own wand: a wand can contain an encounter power of any class capable of using wands. When you craft a wand, you can choose any encounter power that you know or that is available to your class, which becomes a daily item power for the wand you craft. You cannot choose anything other than a class power (you can't choose a paragon path power, for instance).<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When crafting a custom wand, the minimum level of the wand depends on the level of the power with which you infuse it:<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Wand Level</th><th>Power Level</th></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>2 or 3</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>6 or 7</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>10 or 13</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>16 or 17</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>22 or 23</td></tr></table> </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 242.</p>"

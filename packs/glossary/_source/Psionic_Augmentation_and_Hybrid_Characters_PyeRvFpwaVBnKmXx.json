				"content":"<h1>Psionic Augmentation and Hybrid Characters</h1><p>If either of your hybrid classes have the Psionic Augmentation class feature, you follow slightly different rules to build your character.<br/></p><h3>Both Classes Have Psionic Augmentation:</h3><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If both of your hybrid classes have Psionic Augmentation, you gain powers and power points at the same rate as a normal class that has the class feature. Follow the rules for choosing powers as detailed in \"Creating a Hybrid Character,\" but ignore references to encounter attack powers, since you do not gain any from either class.<br/></p><h3>Only One Class Has Psionic Augmentation:</h3><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only one of your classes has Psionic Augmentation, you can use the rules for choosing powers as detailed in \"Creating a Hybrid Character,\" except that you follow different rules for choosing encounter attack powers.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 1st level, you choose either the hybrid power point option (below) or a 1st level encounter attack power from the class that includes such powers. You start with no power points unless you either choose the hybrid power point option or gain them from a source other than your classes.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you reach 3rd level, see \"Gaining Encounter Attack Powers\" below for how to proceed.<br/></p><h4>Hybrid Power Point Option</h4> When you choose the hybrid power point option, you gain a number of power points based on the levels of the augmentable at-will powers that you have. To determine your power point total, consult the table for how many power points each of the power is worth, and then add those points together.<br/><br/>HYBRID POWER POINTS<br/><table><tr><th>Power Level</th><th>Power Points</th></tr><tr><td>1–10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>11–20</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>21–30</td><td>6</td></tr></table>Whenever you gain, retrain, or swap an augmentable at-will attack power from your class, recalculate your power point total.<br/><h4>Gaining Encounter Attack Powers</h4>At 3rd level, whether you gain an encounter attack power or power points is determined by your choice at 1st level:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you chose to gain an encounter attack power at 1st level, you gain the hybrid power point option at 3rd level and can swap your augmentable 1st-level at-will attack power for a new augmentable at-will attack power of 3rd level or lower.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the hybrid power point option at 1st level, at 3rd level you must choose a 3rd-level or lower encounter power from your class that includes such powers.<br/><br/>At 7th level, you choose one of the following options, regardless of what you chose before:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You gain a 7th-level or lower encounter attack power from your class that includes such powers.<br/><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR</i><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You gain an augementable 7th-level or lower at-will attack power, and your power point total increases accordingly.<br/><br/>When you reach a higher level at which you can swap an encounter attack power, you can instead swap an augmentable at-will attack power, but you must still keep at least one encounter attack power from your class that includes them.<br/><br/><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 137.</p>"

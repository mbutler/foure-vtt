				"content":"<h1>Keeping Watch</h1><p>Adventurers typically take turns keeping watch while their companions sleep. If five characters are in your group, each of you can take a turn on watch duty for 1Â½ hours and sleep for 6 hours, so that you spend a total of 7Â½ hours resting.<br/><br/>When it's your turn on watch, you actively look for signs of danger. When you start your shift on watch, make a Perception check. If something occurs during your watch, the DM uses the result of your Perception check to determine whether you notice.<br/><br/>If your entire group sleeps at the same time without setting a watch, the DM uses your individual passive Perception scores, counting the –5 penalty for being asleep, to determine whether you hear approaching danger and wake up.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 263.</p>"

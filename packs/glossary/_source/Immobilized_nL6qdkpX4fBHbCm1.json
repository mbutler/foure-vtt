It can still stand up when it's prone, pull an item from a backpack, or attack normally. It might have taken a serious, but temporary, injury to the legs, or it could be stuck to the ground by a huge cobweb.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature wrapped up in animated vines might be restrained instead (see below); that condition imposes more restrictions on the creature's ability to attack and defend itself. A creature that is actually paralyzed, such as by the bite of a ghoul, might be stunned rather than immobilized or restrained.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 221, Rules Compendium, page(s) 232, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 123.</p>"

Members of a race have various characteristics in common. A character's race confers certain traits to the character and helps determine the character's starting languages.<br/>The races that players choose from are often referred to as character races, and the adventurer members of a race typically have racial traits that other members of the race lack.</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 61.</p>"

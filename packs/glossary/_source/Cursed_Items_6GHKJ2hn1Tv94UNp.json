Most cursed items were created by accident, though some wicked makers create them intentionally, to laugh as their wielders march toward doom.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cursed item usually appears benign. The wielder knows all of the item's powers, but the properties remain hidden until triggered. Once a character triggers the property, the character cannot get rid of the item by any means short of a Disenchant Magic Item ritual, a Remove Affliction ritual, or similar magic.</p><p>Published in The Book of Vile Darkness, page(s) 2-74.</p>"

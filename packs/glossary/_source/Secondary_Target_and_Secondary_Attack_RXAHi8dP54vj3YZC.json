				"content":"<h1>Secondary Target and Secondary Attack</h1><p>Some powers allow you to make secondary (or even tertiary) attacks. A \"Hit,\" a \"Miss,\" or an \"Effect\" entry tells you when to make a secondary attack. Unless otherwise noted, the attack type and the range of a secondary attack are the same as the power's, and the secondary attack doesn't require a separate action.<br/>Some powers give you the ability to make a secondary attack at a point later in an encounter, after the initial effect takes place. These powers include information about the secondary attack's action type, attack type, range, and effect.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 2, page(s) 219.</p>"

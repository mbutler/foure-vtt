Often the only way to end this condition is by using a power or a magical ritual.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, a creature falls prone when it becomes unconscious. The DM might decide that a petrified creature instead remains upright, posed like a statue.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Rules Compendium, page(s) 232, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 124.</p>"

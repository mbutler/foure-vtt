Class helps determine various statistics, including defenses and hit points, and it provides an adventurer with most of his or her powers. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only rare nonplayer characters and monsters have classes. If a nonplayer character or a monster does have a class, the creature has only the class features, powers, and such that are included in the stat block. In other words, the creature functions as a full member of the class only if the creature's stat block says it does.</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 61-62.</p>"

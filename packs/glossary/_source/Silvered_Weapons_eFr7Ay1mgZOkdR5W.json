A single weapon, 30 arrows, 10 crossbow bolts, or 20 sling bullets can be silvered at a cost of 500 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to a weapon without making it less effective.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 220, Rules Compendium, page(s) 269.</p>"

The balloon sits within a wooden or metal frame, beneath which is a boat-shaped cabin that holds the crew, the passengers, and the cargo. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most airships are powered by a magic propeller, some resemble sailing ships and are driven by magically created winds. An airship requires a crew of five (in addition to the pilot) to fly effectively. Including the gas balloon, this vessel is 8 squares long, 4 squares wide, and 6 squares tall.</p><p>Published in Adventurer's Vault, page(s) 20.</p>"

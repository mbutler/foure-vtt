The one type of opportunity action that every creature can take is an opportunity attack.<br/><br/>Someone Else's Turn: A creature cannot take an opportunity action on its own turn. The action interrupts some event on another creature's turn.<br/><br/>Once per Turn: A creature can take no more than one opportunity action per turn (but it can take one on each other creature's turn).<br/><br/>Interrupt: Just like an immediate interrupt, an opportunity action interrupts its trigger, taking place before the trigger finishes.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 268, Rules Compendium, page(s) 196.</p>"

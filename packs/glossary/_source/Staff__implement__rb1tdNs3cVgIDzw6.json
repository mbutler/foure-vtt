Staffs are sometimes crowned with decorative crystals or other symbols of magical power.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This implement also counts as a quarterstaff. Even a creature who doesn't have proficiency with the staff as an implement can use it as a weapon, but if the staff is magical, the creature cannot use its properties or powers, only its enhancement bonus and critical hit effect.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When used as an implement, a staff requires only one hand to wield; however, if used as a weapon, it must be wielded in both hands.</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 274.</p>"

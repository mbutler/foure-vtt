The creature can still take free actions.<br/>✦&nbsp; The creature can't take immediate actions or opportunity actions.<br/>✦&nbsp; The creature grants combat advantage.<br/>✦&nbsp; The creature can't flank.<br/><br/>The dazed condition is a common way of representing a general state of stupor. Dazed creatures don't act as quickly as normal or respond to danger as readily. A creature might be dazed because it took a hard blow to the head, a spell assaulted its mind, or a prayer called forth a clap of thunder around it.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 220, Rules Compendium, page(s) 229, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 122.</p>"

Melee attacks don't create areas of effect.<br/><br/>Range: A melee attack's range usually equals your melee reach. (Sometimes a power specifies that it affects only adjacent targets, though, so even if you're using a reach weapon, you can't attack more distant targets with that power.)<br/><br/>Reach: Most characters have a reach of 1 square. Certain powers, feats, and weapons can increase your reach.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 270.</p>"

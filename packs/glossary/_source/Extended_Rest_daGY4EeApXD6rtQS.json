The creature can engage in light activity that doesn't require much exertion.<br/><br/>Regain Hit Points and Healing Surges: At the end of an extended rest, a creature regains all lost hit points and all spent healing surges.<br/><br/>Regain the Use of Powers: At the end of an extended rest, a creature regains the use of expended encounter powers and daily powers.<br/><br/>Action Points: At the end of an extended rest, a creature loses any unspent action points, but starts fresh with 1 action point.<br/><br/>Interruptions: If anything interrupts a creature's extended rest, such as an attack, add the time spent dealing with the interruption to the total time the creature needs to spend in the extended rest.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 263, Rules Compendium, page(s) 172.</p>"

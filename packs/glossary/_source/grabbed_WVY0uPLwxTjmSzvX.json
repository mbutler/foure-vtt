Other common tactics for escaping a grab are to teleport away or to be pulled, pushed, or slid out of the grabber's reach. Using forced movement on the grabber can also end a grab, as long as the movement results in the grabbed creature being out of the grabbing effect's range.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a creature is grabbed, the grabber can try to move it (see \"Moving a Grabbed Target\").</p><p>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 217, Rules Compendium, page(s) 231, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 123.</p>"

If the weapon is listed in the Player's Handbook or it is a larger version of a PH weapon, use the rules for it found there. Otherwise, the characters lack proficiency with it, and the weapon deals its listed damage but gains none of the other effects that a monster gains from it.</p><p>Published in Monster Manual, page(s) 283.</p>"

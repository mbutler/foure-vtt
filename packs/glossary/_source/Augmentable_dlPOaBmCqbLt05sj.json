				"content":"<h1>Augmentable</h1><p>An effect type. A power that has the augmentable keyword has optional augmentations, which a character can use at the cost of power points. Only certain characters have power points, usually as a result of their class. Unless otherwise noted, using an augmentable power follows these rules.<br/><br/>Decide First: A creature must decide whether and how to augment an augmentable power when it chooses to use the power, before making any attack rolls or applying any of the power's effects.<br/><br/>Power Point Cost: An augmentation specifies its cost in power points. For example, \"Augment 1\" means a creature must spend 1 power point to use an augmentation. The creature must spend the required power points when it decides to use the augmentation. <br/><br/>One at a Time: A creature can use only one augmentation on a power at a time, so it can't, for example, spend 3 power points to use both a 1-point and a 2-point augmentation on a single power.<br/><br/>Replace Base Effects: When a power is augmented, changes to the power are noted in the description of the augmentation. If an augmentation includes a specific power entry, such as \"Hit\" or \"Effect,\" that entry replaces the entry in the base power that has the same name. An augmented version of a power is otherwise identical to the base power. <br/><br/>Unaugmented: When a creature uses an augmentable power without augmenting it, the power is referred to as unaugmented for that use (some effects apply only when a power is unaugmented). A power that doesn't have the augmentable keyword is never considered unaugmented. <br/><br/>At-Will Attack Powers: When a power or some other effect lets a creature use an at-will attack power, the creature can choose to use one of its augmentable at-will attack powers, but must use it unaugmented. When a racial trait lets an adventurer choose an extra at-will attack power and the adventurer chooses an augmentable at-will attack power, the power loses both the augmentable keyword and its augmentations.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 216, Rules Compendium, page(s) 115-116, 308.</p>"

A typical square of blocking terrain is completely filled, which prevents diagonal movement across its corners.<br/><br/>No Line of Effect or Line of Sight: Blocking terrain blocks line of effect. It blocks line of sight as well, unless the terrain is transparent.<br/><br/>Cover: A creature can gain cover by positioning itself near blocking terrain. See \"Cover and Concealment\".</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 309, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 122.</p>"

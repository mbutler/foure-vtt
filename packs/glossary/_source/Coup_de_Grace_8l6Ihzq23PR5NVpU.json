				"content":"<h1>Coup de Grace</h1><p>Sometimes a creature has the chance to attack a foe who is completely defenseless. Doing so isn't chivalrous, but it is viciously effective. This action is known as a coup de grace.<br/><br/>Perform a Coup de Grace<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Action: Standard action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Attack Helpless Target: The creature uses one of its attack powers against an adjacent target that is helpless. If the attack hits, it automatically scores a critical hit against the target.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Slaying the Target Outright: If the critical hit deals damage greater than or equal to the target's bloodied value, the target dies.<br/><br/>The most common way for a target to be helpless is to be unconscious; thus, the coup de grace action is typically used against sleeping foes.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 288, Rules Compendium, page(s) 241.</p>"

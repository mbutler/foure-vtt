Typically the creature reappears in the space it left, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is now occupied.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature is normally subjected to this condition because it has been transported to another plane of existence or is engulfed or swallowed. Whatever the cause, the creature's turns start and end as normal.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 233, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>"

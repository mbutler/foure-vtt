The walk action can use special movement modes such as climbing, flying, and swimming.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking this action is safe only when no enemies are nearby. Walking through the middle of a pitched battle is dangerous, since enemies can make opportunity attacks against a walking creature. The way to move safely when enemies are nearby is to shift or teleport.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 292, Rules Compendium, page(s) 252.</p>"

An adventurer can't attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless he or she has a power that allows such an attack, but he or she can attack with either weapon.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 217, Mordenkainen's Magnificent Emporium, page(s) 20, Rules Compendium, page(s) 270.</p>"

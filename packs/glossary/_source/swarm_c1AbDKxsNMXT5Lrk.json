A swarm can occupy the same space as another creature, and an enemy can enter a swarm's space, which is difficult terrain. A swarm cannot be pulled, pushed, or slid by melee or ranged attacks. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swarm can squeeze through any opening large enough for even one of its constituent creatures. For example, a swarm of bats can squeeze through an opening large enough for one of the bats to squeeze through.</p><p>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 218, Monster Manual, page(s) 283, Rules Compendium, page(s) 316, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 125.</p>"

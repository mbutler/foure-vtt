Arcana, Dungeoneering, History, Nature, and Religion are the skills most commonly used to make knowledge checks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refer to these rules whenever a creature is making a knowledge check, regardless of the skill it is using.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Action: No action. A creature either knows or doesn't know the information.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; DC: See the Knowledge Checks table. The check DC increases based on the topic and how common the knowledge is. A Dungeon Master might decide that certain information is available only to creatures that have training in the appropriate knowledge skill.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Success: The creature recalls a relevant piece of lore in the field of knowledge or recognizes a clue related to it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Failure: The creature doesn't recall any pertinent information. The Dungeon Master might allow a new check if further information comes to light.<br/><br/><table><tr><th>Information</th><th>DC</th></tr><tr><td>General</td><td>Easy</td></tr><tr><td>Specialized</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>Esoteric</td><td>Hard</td></tr></table></p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 313, 129.</p>"

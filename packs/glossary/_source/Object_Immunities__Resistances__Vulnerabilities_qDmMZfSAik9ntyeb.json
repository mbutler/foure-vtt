For instance, a magic altar might be immune to fire.<br/><br/>Objects don't have any universal resistances or vulnerabilities, but the DM might rule that some kinds of damage are particularly effective against a certain object—the object has vulnerability to that damage. For instance, a gauzy curtain or a pile of dry papers might have vulnerable 5 fire because any spark is likely to destroy it.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the DM might occasionally decide that an unusual material resists a type of damage, typically having resist 5 or 10 to that damage.</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 177.</p>"

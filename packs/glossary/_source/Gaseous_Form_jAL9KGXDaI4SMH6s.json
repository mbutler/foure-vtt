While gaseous, the monster is insubstantial and gains a fly speed equal to its land speed, as well as the ability to hover.<br/><br/>A monster cannot make attacks while in gaseous form unless otherwise noted, but it can move unhindered through porous obstacles that would otherwise prevent movement (such as under a door or through a cracked window).</p><p>Published in Monster Manual, page(s) 281.</p>"

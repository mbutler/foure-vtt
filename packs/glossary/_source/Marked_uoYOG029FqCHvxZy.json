When a target is marked, it has a hard time ignoring the creature that marked it. Most marking effects have very short durations, or else they require the marking creature to remain a threat to the marked target.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 277, Monster Manual 2, page(s) 218, Player's Handbook 3, page(s) 222, Rules Compendium, page(s) 232, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 124.</p>"

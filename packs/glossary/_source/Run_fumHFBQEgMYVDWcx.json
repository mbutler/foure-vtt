				"content":"<h1>Run</h1><p>By taking the run action, a creature can use an all-out sprint when it really needs to cover ground quickly. The creature has to lower its guard to make best speed, however, and it can't attack very well.<br/><br/>Run<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Action: Move action.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Speed + 2: The creature moves up to its speed plus 2 additional squares. For instance, if its speed is 6, the creature can move up to 8 squares when it runs.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; -5 Penalty to Attack Rolls: The creature takes a -5 penalty to attack rolls until the start of its next turn.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✦&nbsp; Grant Combat Advantage: As soon as the creature begins running, it grants combat advantage until the start of its next turn.<br/><br/>Despite the action's name, a creature isn't always literally running when it takes this action. The action can include other movement modes such as climbing, flying, and swimming.</p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 291, Rules Compendium, page(s) 248.</p>"

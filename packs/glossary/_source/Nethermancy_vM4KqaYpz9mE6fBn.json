				"content":"<h1>Nethermancy</h1><p>The nethermancer's methods were devised when renegade wizards fled to the Shadowfell long ago and delved into the plane's secrets and the malign influence found there. These original nethermancers identified shadow magic as the impetus for the Shadowfell's creation. The strength of shadow magic derives from the dark stuff that the primordials rejected when they first gave form to substance. Nethermancers focus their efforts on extricating shadow from various environments, then blending it with arcane forces to create magical effects. Among other manifestations, such spells excite or dull the senses, spin creatures from raw shadow, and punch holes through reality to allow swift passage.<br/></p><p>Published in Heroes of Shadow.</p>"

See \"Forced Movement\" and \"Teleportation\".<br/><br/>Damage: Hindering terrain almost always has the potential to harm creatures that enter it, either by causing them to fall or by dealing damage to them directly. (Some hindering terrain might impose a penalty or a harmful condition without dealing damage.)</p><p>Published in Rules Compendium, page(s) 312, Monster Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale, page(s) 123.</p>"

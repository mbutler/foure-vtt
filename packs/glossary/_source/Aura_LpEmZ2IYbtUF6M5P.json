				"content":"<h1>Aura</h1><p>An aura is a continuous effect that emanates from a creature. Unless otherwise noted, an aura uses the following rules.<br/><br/>Fills an Area: The aura fills the creature's space and each square that is both within a specified distance of the creature and within line of effect of it. For instance, an aura 1 affects each square adjacent to the creature. A creature is normally unaffected by its own aura.<br/><br/>Unaffected by the Environment: The aura is unaffected by environmental phenomena and terrain, although blocking terrain blocks an aura. For instance, an aura of fire is unaffected by an area of extreme cold.<br/><br/>Overlapping Auras: If auras overlap and impose penalties to the same roll or game statistic, a creature affected by the overlapping auras is subjected to the worst penalty; the penalties are not cumulative. For instance, if a creature is affected by three overlapping auras that each impose a -2 penalty to attack rolls, the creature takes a -2 penalty, not a -6 penalty.<br/><br/>Deactivating an Aura: A creature can take a minor action to deactivate or reactivate one of its auras. However, certain auras have set durations and cannot be reactivated after they end. <br/><br/>Death or Unconsciousness Ends: A creature's auras end immediately when it falls unconscious or dies.</p><p>Published in Monster Manual 2, page(s) 6, Rules Compendium, page(s) 308.</p>"

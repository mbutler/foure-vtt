			"value":"<p>The Centered Breath tradition focuses on honing your mental awareness to better harness psionic magic. This tradition teaches that only by controlling yourself can you control your environment. The tradition's adherents are typically ascetics, whose monasteries stand in quiet corners of the world where the monks can train and study without distraction. In some of these monasteries, speech is forbidden except for one hour each day. </p><p>Flurry of Blows: You gain the centered flurry of blows power. </p><p>Mental Equilibrium: You gain a +1 bonus to Fortitude.

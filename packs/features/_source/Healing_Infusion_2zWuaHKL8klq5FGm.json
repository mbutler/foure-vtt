			"value":"<p>You can create healing infusions for later use. At the end of an extended rest, you create two healing infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. At 16th level, you instead create three healing infusions.</p>\n<p>You determine the effect of a healing infusion at the time you use the power, not at the time you create it. When you use a Healing Infusion power, you expend one of the infusions you created during your last extended rest. During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish one of the infusions expended.</p>\n<p>When you create an artificer, you can choose to take the shielding elixir power in place of the resistive formula power. If you do so, the shielding elixir healing infusion functions exactly as other healing infusions do, with regards to their use and replenishment. If you choose the shielding elixir infusion, you cannot create the resistive formula healing infusion at all.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.m2lFdRzWhg9p3j7S]{Healing Infusion: Curative Admixture}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.GeA89J6KaiXyFhHd]{Healing Infusion: Resistive Formula}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.BlaryTet0A4znCfN]{Healing Infusion: Shielding Elixir}</p>",

When you attack with a spirit power, you choose which spirit companion to use for the attack; you don't make the attack through both of them. When an effect applies to creatures adjacent to your spirit companion, that effect applies to creatures adjacent to both spirit companions. The second spirit companion disappears at the end of your next turn. </p>",

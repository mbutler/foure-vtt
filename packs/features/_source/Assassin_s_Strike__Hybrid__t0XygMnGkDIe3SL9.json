			"value":"<p>When you can choose an encounter attack power that has a level from your hybrid classes, you can choose the hybrid version of assassin's strike instead. This power counts as assassin's strike for purposes of feats and paragon path features. If you already have assassin's strike and an encounter attack power from your other hybrid class, then instead of choosing or replacing an encounter attack power, you can increase the extra damage dealt by your assassin's strike by 1d10.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.jhzDtb4WPv6SV9BZ]{Assassin's Strike (Hybrid)}</p>",

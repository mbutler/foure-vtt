You can expend a soul shard as a free action either to subject your assassin's shroud target to another shroud or to gain a +1 bonus to a single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. Alternatively, you can expend three soul shards as a free action to regain the use of shade form. </p><p>You can have up to five soul shards at a time. After an extended rest, your unexpended soul shards vanish, but you gain a soul shard. </p>",

You gain the oath of enmity power.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.GLaB471ns0JZ6wCX]{Oath of Enmity}</p>\n<p>AVENGER OVERVIEW</p>\n<p>Swinging a melee weapon in combat, you wield devastating divine power against your foes. You have a secondary assortment of ranged and close implement powers that let you draw your foes closer to you, teleport near them, or scorch them with divine wrath from afar.</p>\n<p>Religion</p>\n<p>An avenger might serve any deity, but an avenger is more likely to worship an unaligned deity than a god of good or lawful good. Avengers of Ioun are among the most common, fighting a war of knowledge against the servants of Vecna. Unaligned avengers often revere the Raven Queen, Erathis, or Sehanine, and evil avengers often serve Asmodeus, Lolth, Tiamat, or Zehir.</p>\n<p>Races</p>\n<p>Elves and razorclaw shifters make excellent pursuing avengers, and devas excel as isolating avengers. Many avengers are human, because most of the hidden monasteries that produce avengers are of human origin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

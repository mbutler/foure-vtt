			"value":"<p>Once per day when you die, you return to the world as a bodiless disincarnation of your former self. You regain hit points equal to your bloodied value, your old body disperses into motes of light, and you appear as a spectral force floating over the battlefield in the square where you died. Until your next short rest, you are insubstantial, you have phasing and a fly speed equal to your speed (you can hover, but have a maximum altitude of 2 squares), and when you use your memory of a thousand lifetimes power you roll 2 dice instead of 1, using either result. After you take a short rest, you appear in your new body in a flash of radiant light. </p>",

			"value":"<p>Barbarian daily attack powers have the rage keyword. They allow you to unleash powerful bursts of emotion, willpower, and primal energy. Each rage power starts with a mighty attack, and then you enter a rage, which grants an ongoing benefit.</p>\n<p>At 5th level, you gain the rage strike power, which lets you channel an unused rage power into a devastating attack while you're raging. Using rage strike is an alternative to using a second rage power in a climactic battle; it gives you the damage output of a daily power without forcing you to enter a different rage.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.GnWJkEwZfgiSPXqM]{Rage Strike}</p>",

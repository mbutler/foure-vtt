			"value":"<p>You have forged a bargain with ancient, amoral powers of the Feywild. Some are primitive earth spirits, grim and menacing; some are capricious wood, sky, or water spirits; and others are incarnations of seasons or natural forces who roam the faerie realm like wild gods. They bestow magic that ranges from feral and savage to wondrous and enchanting. </p><p>Eyebite: You know the eyebite spell. </p><p>Misty Step: You have the Misty Step pact boon. You instantly transform into silver mist that streams a short distance and reforms, allowing you to flee or maneuver to set up a deadly attack. </p><p>When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you can immediately teleport 3 squares as a free action. </p>",

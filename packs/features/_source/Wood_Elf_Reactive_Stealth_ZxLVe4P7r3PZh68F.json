As a result, many wood elves develop the instinct to fade from sight at the first sign of danger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Benefits:&nbsp;</em>If you have any cover or concealment when you roll initiative, you can make a Stealth check to hide at the same time. This benefit replaces Group Awareness.</p>",

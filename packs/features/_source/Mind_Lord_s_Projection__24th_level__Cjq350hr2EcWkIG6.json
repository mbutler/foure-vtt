			"value":"<p>Whenever you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you can project your mind into the body of a willing ally within 10 squares of you. Your body is still subject to effects, but you ignore these while inhabiting your host body. Instead, you are subject to any effects on your host body, though you do not take damage that it takes. Your body is still dying, so it continues to take damage and make death saving throws as normal. If your body dies, you die. If your host body dies, you can project your mind into the body of another willing ally within 10 squares of your current host. You return to your body when it is no longer dying or dead. </p><p>While inhabiting your ally's body, you occupy his or her space but otherwise continue to act as yourself, using the same initiative and with access to your class features, powers, skills, feats, power points, and so forth. You use your own attack bonuses, skill bonuses, damage bonuses, and so on, but you must still meet any requirements (but not prerequisites) of your powers or feats. If you have a power that deals [W] damage, the weapon your host body is wielding determines that value. You continue to receive the benefit of your magic item enhancement bonuses and properties, but you cannot use those items' powers. </p>",

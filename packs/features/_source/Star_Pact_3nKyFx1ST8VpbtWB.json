			"value":"<p>You have mastered the astrologer's art, learning the secret names of the stars and gazing into the Far Realm beyond, gaining great power thereby. You can call upon powers that madden or terrify your enemies, manipulate chance and fate, or scour your foes with icy banes and curses drawn from beyond the night sky. </p><p>Dire Radiance: You know the dire radiance spell. </p><p>Fate of the Void: You have the Fate of the Void pact boon. Your curse intermingles with the lost vitality of a cursed enemy to reveal a glimpse of the future to you. </p><p>When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain a +1 bonus to any single d20 roll you make before the end of your next turn (attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check). If you don't use this bonus by the end of your turn, it is lost. </p><p>This bonus is cumulative; if three cursed enemies drop to 0 hit points or fewer before your next turn, you gain a +3 bonus to a d20 roll during your turn. </p>",

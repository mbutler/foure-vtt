			"value":"<p>You gain the Arcane Familiar feat as a bonus feat.</p>\n<p>At the end of each extended rest, when you confer with your familiar you can replace one of your wizard daily attack powers or wizard utility powers with another wizard power of the same type. The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level.</p>\n<p>When you reach level 24, your familiar enables you to spend an action point on your turn to regain the use of one of your expended wizard encounter attack powers, instead of taking an extra action. If you do so, you gain combat advantage against every target of that power the next time you use it during the current encounter.</p>\n<p>Published in Heroes of the Feywild, page(s) 87.</p>",

			"value":"<p>Whenever you roll a natural 1 or 20 on an attack roll or saving throw during an encounter, you gain 1 luck token. Luck tokens remain until you spend them or until you take an extended rest, at which point you remove all unexpended luck tokens. </p><p>Whenever you make an attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check on your turn, you can expend one luck token after seeing the result. Roll a d6. On a result of 1-3, you gain a +1 bonus to the triggering roll. On a 4 or 5, you gain a +2 bonus to the triggering roll. On a 6, you can reroll the triggering roll and use the result you like. You have no limit to the number of luck tokens you can spend during an encounter, but you can spend only one token per turn. </p>",

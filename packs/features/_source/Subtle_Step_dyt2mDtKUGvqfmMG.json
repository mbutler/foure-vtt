By the time wild elves are of warrior age, those childhood lessons allow them to move deeper into battle as well as to break free of it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Benefits:&nbsp;</em>Once per encounter, you can shift up to your speed as a move action. This benefit replaces elven accuracy.</p>",

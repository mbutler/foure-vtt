Doing so causes the power to deal radiant damage instead of its normal damage type, and the power gains the radiant keyword for this attack. If this attack hits, the target also gains vulnerable radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier until the end of your next turn. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 376, page(s) 55. </p>",

			"value":"<p>Long ago a forgotten race of devils created a secret path to power and taught it to the tieflings of old to weaken their fealty to Asmodeus. In his wrath, Asmodeus destroyed the scheming devils and struck their very names from the memory of all beings-but you dare to study their perilous secrets anyway. </p><p>Hellish Rebuke: You know the hellish rebuke spell. </p><p>Dark One's Blessing: You have the Dark One's Blessing pact boon. You instantly gain vitality from a cursed enemy when that enemy falls. </p><p>When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your level. </p>",

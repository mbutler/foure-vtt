You appear in a space of your choice within 5 squares of where you died and have hit points equal to your bloodied value. You are freed of any temporary effects existing at the time of your death, but permanent conditions remain. Each additional time you are slain during the same day increases the time until you can rise again. </p><p>Second Death: Return to life at the end of the encounter. </p><p>Third Death: Return to life 1 hour after the end of the encounter. </p><p>Fourth Death: Return to life 12 hours after the end of the encounter. </p><p>Fifth Death or More: Return to life 24 hours after the end of the encounter. </p><p>If you don't use this ability, you can still be raised from the dead normally. </p><p>Published in Martial Power, page(s) 157. </p>",

In addition, enemies you hit with attack powers that have the cold keyword take a -2 penalty to saving throws made to end any ongoing effects these powers create. Each time an enemy fails a saving throw to end one of these effects, that enemy gains vulnerable 10 cold until the end of your next turn. </p>",

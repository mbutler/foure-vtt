			"value":"<p>Once per day, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you regain all of your hit points and transform into a Large platinum dragon. While in this form, you gain darkvision, resist 20 cold, resist 20 fire, fly 10 (hover), dragon bite, and breath weapon (see below for these powers). In addition, each enemy within 5 squares of you takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls while you remain in this form. </p><p>Beyond those changes, becoming a dragon doesn't change your game statistics. Your equipment becomes part of your dragon form, but you drop anything you are holding, except implements you can use. You continue to gain the benefits of the equipment you wear. You can use the properties and the powers of implements as well as magic items that you wear, but not the properties or the powers of weapons or the powers of wondrous items. While equipment is part of your dragon form, it cannot be removed, and anything in a container that is part of your dragon form is inaccessible. </p><p>This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until you use breath weapon, at which point you resume your normal form. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 378. </p>",

You gain a +2 bonus to Will against aberrant creatures, and you know the location of all aberrant creatures within 5 squares of you at all times. You don't grant combat advantage to those creatures, and if they have cover or concealment when you attack them, you don't take the -2 penalty to attack rolls against them. </p><p>When you will it, this focus manifests as a topaz gemstone in the center of your brow. </p>",

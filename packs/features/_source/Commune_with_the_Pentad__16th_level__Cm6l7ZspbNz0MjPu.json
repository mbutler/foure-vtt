			"value":"<p>Once each day during a short rest, you can commune with one of the Mithral Pentad. Make an Arcana, Nature, or Religion check. Divide the result of the check by 10 (round down). This determines the number of questions you can ask the dragon. The dragon answers yes or no questions only, and the dragon might withhold answers if the question has no bearing on the eradication of evil dragons. A question that results in no answer still counts against the total number available. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 385, page(s) 10. </p>",

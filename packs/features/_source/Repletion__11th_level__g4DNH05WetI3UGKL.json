			"value":"<p>Psionic energy sustains you. You no longer need to breathe, eat, or drink. You never make Endurance checks to resist the effects of starvation, thirst, or suffocation. </p><p>In addition, you do not sleep. You instead enter a period of dormancy during which time you replenish the psionic energy needed to sustain your form. You need to spend four hours in this state to gain the same benefit other races gain from taking a six-hour extended rest. While dormant, you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. </p>",

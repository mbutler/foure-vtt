If you get this result four times before you take a rest, you die. </p><p>8-17: No change. </p><p>18 or higher: Spend a healing surge. When you do so, you are considered to have 0 hit points, and then your healing surge restores hit points as normal. You are no longer dying, and you are conscious but still prone. If you roll 18 or higher but have no healing surges left, your condition doesn't change. </p>",

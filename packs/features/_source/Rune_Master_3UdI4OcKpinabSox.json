			"value":"<p>Some of your powers have the runic keyword. When you are going to use a runic power, you first choose one of the runes noted in the power-either the rune of destruction or the rune of protection-and then use the power, applying the chosen rune's effects. The moment you choose the rune, you enter its rune state. You remain in that rune state until you enter another rune state or until the end of the encounter. Whenever you enter the rune state of the rune of destruction or the rune of protection, you gain an additional benefit. The benefit lasts while you're in the rune state.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.uyoU8Iev4DiA3hHG]{Rune of Destruction}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.izjf7SsU04v8tRYa]{Rune of Protection}</p>",

			"value":"<p>When you spend an action point to take an extra action, instead of deducting the action point from your total you can deduct it from the total of any willing ally you can see. Similarly, as long as you are willing and conscious, any ally who can see you can deduct an action point from your total instead of from his or her total when spending an action point to take an extra action. The normal limit of action points spent during an encounter still applies. Whenever you spend an ally's action point to take an extra action, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls until the start of your next turn. </p>",

The next time that enemy shifts or attacks a creature other than you while the enemy is adjacent to you, you can make an opportunity attack against the enemy. If you mark a new enemy with this feature, any previous mark you have made with this feature ends. </p><p>Published in Player's Handbook, page(s) 74, Class Compendium. </p>",

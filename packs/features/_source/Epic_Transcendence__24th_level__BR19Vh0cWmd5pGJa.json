Unless some calamity befalls you, you retain your present age and appearance. </p><p>Finally, once per encounter as a minor action, you can speed your recovery by placing your body into a state of suspended animation. While in suspended animation, you are unconscious, have regeneration 5 while bloodied, and can make saving throws at both the start and the end of your turns. Your suspended animation ends at the end of the encounter or when you choose to end it at the end of your turn. </p>",

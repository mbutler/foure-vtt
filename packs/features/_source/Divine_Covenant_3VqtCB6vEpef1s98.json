			"value":"<p>Invokers wield ancient divine power that is not accessible to most mortals -- only to those who enter into a personal covenant with a god. Invokers undergo long years of study and testing. Only after that time are they allowed to enter into the final covenant that grants them access to this class's powers. Some say that, in the final swearing of the covenant, the invoker's god briefly manifests, but the details of an invoker's initiation are a closely held secret.</p>\n<p>Choose one of the options described below. The Divine Covenant you choose provides you with a Channel Divinity power and a covenant manifestation that takes effect whenever you use a divine encounter or daily attack power. Your choice also provides bonuses to certain invoker powers, as detailed in those powers.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.KAGNV71YeISzFdfW]{Covenant of Malediction}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.vTzqnNsDRlQLtyYH]{Covenant of Preservation}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.ZovpHl167Ww04Ybh]{Preserver's Rebuke}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-features.TmthgsSl8Fr6LqeK]{Covenant of Wrath}@UUID[Compendium.dnd-4e-compendium.module-powers.dQsOoIFN49t6YT3s]{Armor of Wrath}</p>",

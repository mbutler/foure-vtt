			"value":"<p>At the end of each of your extended rests, you can prepare encounter attack powers, daily attack powers, and utility powers from your spellbook. These are the powers that you can use during that day, in addition to your at-will attack powers, cantrips, and nonwizard powers, such as a racial power. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day.</p>\n<p>Find your level on the Spells Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many encounter attack powers, daily attack powers, and utility powers you are allowed to prepare each day. You cannot prepare more than one encounter attack power, daily attack power, or utility power of any given level on the same day. For example, a 14th-level mage who has taken the enigmatic mage paragon path can prepare four encounter attack powers per day. Her spellbook contains multiple encounter attack powers at various levels. She can prepare four powers from any of the levels, as long as none of the prepared powers are of the same level.</p>\n<p>SPELLS PREPARED PER DAY</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Level </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Encounter </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Daily </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Utility </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3-4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7-8</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10-15</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16-21</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22-30</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*Certain wizard paragon paths, such as the enigmatic mage, allow you to prepare one additional spell per day in certain cases.</p>",

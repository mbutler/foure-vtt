			"value":"<p>You can store and channel the entropic flux that surrounds you. This barely controlled chaos is represented by a pool of entropy points. Your pool has 0 entropy points at the end of a short rest or an extended rest. Whenever you roll a natural 20 on any d20 roll, you add 1 entropy point to this pool. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on any d20 roll, you subtract 1 entropy point from the pool (to a minimum of 0). </p><p>Once per round, when you roll a d20 and dislike the result, you can spend any number of entropy points from your pool to gain a bonus to that roll of +1 per point spent. If you have spent entropy points since the start of your turn, you cannot spend more until the start of your next turn. </p>",

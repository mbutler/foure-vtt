			"value":"<p>At last, you have reached the point where you can trick the greatest of the gods and primordials. Even slipping into the Nine Hells and snatching away the scepter from a Lord of the Nine's hand is not beyond you. If they discover something is missing, you can stay hidden from sight, even when your prey is looking right at you. </p><p>You gain a passive Stealth score equal to 10 + your Stealth modifier. Any creature that has a passive Perception lower than your passive Stealth score, or that has an active Perception check result that does not equal or surpass your passive Stealth score, cannot see you unless you choose to let that creature see you. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 388. </p>",

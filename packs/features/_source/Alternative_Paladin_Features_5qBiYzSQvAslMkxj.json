Being subject to it means the target is marked by you for a duration specified in the description of the power or feat. Unless otherwise noted, the mark ends before the specified duration if someone else marks the target.</p>\n<p>Until the mark ends, the target takes radiant damage equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier the first time each round it makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target. The damage increases to 6 + your Charisma modifier at 11th level and 9 + your Charisma modifier at 21st level.</p>\n<p>Divine sanction is meant to complement divine challenge. You can use divine challenge to mark one creature and use divine sanction to mark others. Divine sanction has fewer restrictions than divine challenge so that you can easily use the two in concert.</p>\n<p>PALADINS AND DEITIES</p>\n<p>As fervent crusaders in their chosen cause, paladins must choose a deity. Paladins choose a specific faith to serve, as well as an alignment. You must choose an alignment identical to the alignment of your patron deity; a paladin of a good deity must be good, a paladin of a lawful good deity must be lawful good, and a paladin of an unaligned deity must be unaligned. Evil and chaotic evil paladins do exist in the world, but they are almost always villains, not player characters.</p>\n<p>Paladins are not granted their powers directly by their deity, but instead through various rites performed when they first become paladins. Most of these rites involve days of prayer, vigils, tests and trials, and ritual purification followed by a knighting ceremony, but each faith has its own methods. This ceremony of investiture gives a paladin the ability to wield divine powers. Once initiated, the paladin is a paladin forevermore. How justly, honorably, or compassionately the paladin wields those powers from that day forward is up to him, and paladins who stray too far from the tenets of their faith are punished by other members of the faithful.</p>\n<p>Good, Lawful Good, and Unaligned Deities</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Deity </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Alignment </strong></td>\n<td><strong>Areas of Influence </strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Avandra</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Change, luck, trade, travel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bahamut</td>\n<td>Lawful Good</td>\n<td>Justice, honor, nobility, protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corellon</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Arcane magic, spring, beauty, the arts</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Erathis</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Civilization, invention, laws</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ioun</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Knowledge, prophecy, skill</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Kord</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Storms, strength, battle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Melora</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Wilderness, sea</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moradin</td>\n<td>Lawful Good</td>\n<td>Creation, artisans, family</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pelor</td>\n<td>Good</td>\n<td>Sun, summer, agriculture, time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Raven Queen</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Death, fate, winter</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sehanine</td>\n<td>Unaligned</td>\n<td>Trickery, moon, love, autumn</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

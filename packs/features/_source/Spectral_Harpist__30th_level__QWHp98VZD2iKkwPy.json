			"value":"<p>Your fate to become a spectral Harper is nearly ready to claim you. Once per day when you die, your body disintegrates into silver dust and your spirit walks free. You regain maximum hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities, immunity to poison, and resist necrotic 30. You lose half your remaining healing surges. After your next extended rest, you reform your body. If you die in spectral Harper form, you are dead. </p><p>Published in Dragon Magazine 367, page(s) 7. </p>",

			"value":"<p>Once per day, when you die, you can detach your spirit from your body. In arcane spirit form, you heal to maximum hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities. You can cast encounter spells and at-will spells while in arcane spirit form, but you can't cast daily spells, activate magic items, or perform rituals. If you die in arcane spirit form, you're dead. </p><p>At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, your arcane spirit rejoins your body, if your body is still present. Your current hit point total is unchanged, but you no longer experience the other benefits and drawbacks of being in arcane spirit form. </p><p>If your body is missing, you will need other magic to return to life, but can continue adventuring in arcane spirit form if you like. </p>",

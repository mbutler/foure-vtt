			"value":"<p>Once per day, when you die, your body discorporates into a storm of elemental fury. You heal to one-half hit points and gain the insubstantial and phasing qualities. You gain an aura 5, and when enemies begin their turns inside that aura they automatically take 15 lightning and thunder damage, and you can slide that enemy 3 squares. You can use encounter and atwill powers, but you cannot use daily powers, activate magic items, or perform rituals. If you die in elemental storm form, you are dead. </p><p>At the end of the encounter, after a short rest, you reconstitute yourself from the base elements. Your current hit point total is unchanged, but you no longer experience the other benefits and drawbacks from being in elemental storm form. </p>",
